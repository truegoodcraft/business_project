# 02_API_AND_UI_CONTRACT_MAP

- Document purpose: Operational contract index for backend route surface, frontend screens, and UI/backend dependency edges, used to preserve predictability and expose drift before it becomes silent contract breakage.
- Primary authority basis: Mounted routes in `core/api/http.py`, `core/api/routes/*`, `core/reader/api.py`, `core/organizer/api.py`, and SPA usage in `core/ui/app.js`, `core/ui/js/**/*`.
- Best use: Contract checking, route inventory, UI/backend coherence review, wrapper/drift detection.
- Refresh triggers: Route additions/removals, router remounting, screen changes, payload shape changes, legacy-wrapper cleanup.
- Highest-risk drift areas: Missing backup endpoints, transaction endpoints that remain backend stubs, `/app/logs` vs `/logs` naming collision, invoice payment/inventory authority drift, and any future route-level guard drift.
- Key dependent files / modules: `core/api/http.py`, `core/api/routes/items.py`, `core/api/routes/recipes.py`, `core/api/routes/manufacturing.py`, `core/api/routes/ledger_api.py`, `core/api/routes/finance_api.py`, `core/api/routes/invoices.py`, `core/ui/app.js`, `core/ui/js/theme.js`, `core/ui/js/cards/*`.

## Top Contract Drift Risks

This map exists to keep authority boundaries explicit. Canonical, supported, secondary, and legacy or drifted surfaces are separated so operators and maintainers can see where predictability is guaranteed and where compatibility or debt still exists.

- Aligned: backup UI points operators to the canonical encrypted Settings -> Administration export flow; raw `/app/backup` or `/app.db` routes are not mounted and are not canonical.
- Removed: legacy `core/ui/js/cards/home_donuts.js` is no longer mounted; `/app/transactions/summary` and `/app/transactions` remain backend stubs and must not be called from claimed-mode login.
- Canonical: `/session/token` authority is only `core/api/http.py`; it remains unclaimed-mode compatibility and returns `login_required` in claimed mode rather than minting a legacy app-access bypass.
- Canonical: `/auth/state`, `/auth/setup-owner`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/recover`, and `/auth/recovery-codes/regenerate` expose DB-backed auth account lifecycle over `bus_auth_session`. The SPA calls `/auth/state` during boot before protected app mounting, preserves legacy local behavior while unclaimed, requires login UI before normal screens once claimed without a current session, exposes account recovery from the claimed-mode login card, exposes recovery-code regeneration from Security management, and refreshes in-memory auth state after permission/session-sensitive Security UI actions.
- Canonical: `/app/users`, `/app/roles`, `/app/sessions`, and `/app/audit` expose claimed-mode user, role, session, and audit management. The `#/security` UI consumes these routes when permitted; backend route-local permissions remain authoritative and no default users are created.
- Canonical: `/app/invoices` exposes local invoice truth. Invoice lines are billing records only, invoice payment truth is one local invoice-linked sale cash event, and email/payment/customer-portal/accounting automation remains outside Core.
- Drifted: `/app/logs` is the UI event-feed endpoint, while `/logs` is the text runtime log tail; similar names, different contracts.
- Guard posture: Covered protected route families now declare route-local token and permission dependencies. Sensitive mutations retain existing write gates and owner-commit gates where already present; see `04_SECURITY_TRUST_AND_OPERATIONS.md`.
- Password posture: owner setup, user creation, and password reset enforce the central modest minimum password policy from `core/auth/passwords.py` and return controlled `400` errors for blank or too-short passwords.

Phase 5 permission coverage also includes user, role, session, and auth-audit management routes. Phase 6 adds frontend claim/login/logout and Security management screens on top of those routes without changing backend auth authority. Reader, organizer, provider catalog/index/drive scan routes remain intentionally deferred because this phase does not introduce a separate provider/catalog permission vocabulary.

Silent contract drift is a stability risk. The purpose of this document is not to enlarge the declared surface, but to keep the live supported surface explicit and reviewable.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Backup export via Settings -> Administration | Canonical | Uses encrypted `/app/db/export`; raw `/app/backup` and `/app.db` are not mounted. | `core/ui/js/cards/admin.js`, route inventory above |
| Home dashboard transaction widgets | Removed | Endpoints exist as backend stubs, but the legacy widget is no longer mounted. | `core/api/routes/transactions.py` |
| Dedicated `#/runs` and `#/import` screens | Drifted | Routes exist in SPA but render placeholders only. | `core/ui/app.js` |

## UI-to-API dependency map

| Screen | Direct API dependencies |

| Manufacturing | `/app/recipes`, `/app/recipes/{id}`, `/app/manufacture`, `/app/ledger/history` |
| Recipes | `/app/items`, `/app/recipes`, `/app/recipes/{id}`, `/app/recipes` `POST`, `/app/recipes/{id}` `PUT|DELETE` |

| Invoices | `/app/invoices`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/lines`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/issue`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/mark-paid`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/void`, `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/print` |
| Settings | `/app/config`, `/app/update/check`, `/app/update/stage` |
| Settings/Admin | `/app/db/export`, `/app/db/exports`, `/app/db/import/upload`, `/app/db/import/preview`, `/app/db/import/commit` |
| Security | `/auth/state`, `/auth/recovery-codes/regenerate`, `/app/users`, `/app/roles`, `/app/sessions`, `/app/sessions/{id}/revoke`, `/app/audit` |

| Finance | `/app/finance/summary?from=...&to=...`, `/app/finance/transactions?from=...&to=...&limit=100` |

## Update UX and Handoff Notes

- The Settings/sidebar update UX is a manual `Update` button, not a raw download-link primary action.
- `GET /app/update/check` remains read-only and only reports update availability/state.
- `POST /app/update/stage` performs the trusted staging chain and can return `verified_ready` plus restart guidance, but it does not force restart.
- Launcher handoff to `verified_ready` happens only on next start, after DB ownership lock, and follows configured verified launch policy.
- The running EXE is not overwritten; staged versions remain confined under the local update cache until a later launcher handoff.

## Contract-sensitive payloads

| Surface | Status | Key contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/session/token` | Canonical | Returns `{ token }` and sets session cookie. |
| `/app/system/state` | Canonical | Returns `bus_mode`, `is_first_run`, `counts`, `basis`, `build.version`, `build.schema_version`, `status`. |
| `/app/update/check` | Canonical | Returns exactly `current_version`, `latest_version`, `update_available`, `download_url`, `error_code`, `error_message`. |
| `/app/items*` | Canonical | Item rows include identity, unit/dimension, FIFO/on-hand display fields, vendor/location/type fields, and detail batch summary. |
| `/app/recipes*` | Canonical | Uses `quantity_decimal` + `uom`; legacy quantity keys are rejected. |
| `/app/manufacture` | Canonical | Requires `quantity_decimal` + `uom`; success returns `ok`, `status`, `run_id`, `output_unit_cost_cents`. |
| `/app/ledger/history` | Canonical | Returns `{ movements: [...] }`; base `qty_change` is hidden unless `include_base=true` or `BUS_DEV=1`. |
| `/app/finance/summary` | Canonical | Returns KPI totals plus `runs_count`, `units_produced`, `units_sold`, `from`, `to`. |
| `/app/finance/transactions` | Canonical | Returns mixed transaction kinds including `sale`, `refund`, `expense`, `manufacturing_run`, `purchase_inferred`. |
| `/app/db/import/*` | Canonical | Upload stages a file path; preview/commit require `{ path, password }`. |

## Freeze Notes

- Refresh on: mounted route changes, wrapper removals, screen rewrites, payload-key changes, or guard-model changes that affect contract assumptions.
- Fastest invalidators: deleting legacy wrappers, implementing real home transactions, adding/removing `/app/*` routes, or replacing the SPA router.
- Check alongside: `04_SECURITY_TRUST_AND_OPERATIONS.md` for guard/enforcement truth and `05_RELEASE_UPDATE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_FLOW.md` for update-check contract details.
- UI contract audit guard scope: `scripts/ui_contract_audit.ps1` checks forbidden quoted legacy endpoint strings, forbidden legacy endpoint tokens, finance legacy fields, and canonical endpoint containment for stock/purchase/ledger/manufacture calls. It normalizes Windows path separators and narrowly allowlists the known imperial-unit compatibility wrapper in `core/ui/js/token.js` plus the recipe unit label in `core/ui/js/cards/recipes.js`; new matches outside those allowlists remain failures.
- OpenAPI hygiene: duplicate route function names or dual-mounted handlers must use explicit unique `operation_id` values so `/openapi.json` stays warning-free and generated clients have stable operation IDs.
