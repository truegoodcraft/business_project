# 05_RELEASE_UPDATE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_FLOW

- Document purpose: Fast operational reference for version authority, build outputs, release flow, update-check behavior, and deployment assumptions, with emphasis on trustworthy infrastructure and explicit release authority.
- Primary authority basis: `core/version.py`, `scripts/validate_version_governance.py`, `scripts/validate_change_trace.py`, `scripts/build_core.ps1`, `scripts/release-check.ps1`, `BUS-Core.spec`, `core/api/routes/update.py`, `core/services/update.py`, `.github/workflows/governance-guard.yml`, `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml`, `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml`.
- Best use: Validate what is actually implemented for shipping and update checks, and separate that from older docs or tooling assumptions.
- Refresh triggers: Version bumps, build script changes, manifest URL changes, update-service changes, CI/workflow changes, signing or artifact-validation changes.
- Highest-risk drift areas: docs overstating release signing or artifact verification, any future bypass of `.github/workflows/governance-guard.yml`, and any future split between release tags and `core/version.py`.
- Key dependent files / modules: `core/version.py`, `scripts/build_core.ps1`, `scripts/release-check.ps1`, `BUS-Core.spec`, `core/config/manager.py`, `core/api/routes/update.py`, `core/services/update.py`, `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml`.

## Version and Update Authority Matrix

In the current stabilization phase, trustworthy release infrastructure means operators can tell where version truth lives, what the app validates, and what it does not. Update checks are default-on / opt-out for a one-shot startup notice, manual checks remain available, and the app must stay honest about the limits of current verification.

| Concern | Implemented authority | Doc / tooling assumption | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime version | `core/version.py` | FastAPI app version, build script read from same source | Canonical | `VERSION` is the owner-controlled public/release SemVer source. |
| Internal working version | `core/version.py` | Internal reports may expose `INTERNAL_VERSION` | Canonical | `INTERNAL_VERSION` is `X.Y.Z.R`, for repo working revisions only, and must not flow into strict SemVer consumers. |
| Package metadata version | `pyproject.toml` | Packaging stub only | Checked mirror | `scripts/validate_version_governance.py` now fails if `pyproject.toml` diverges from canonical `core/version.py::VERSION`. |
| Version-governance mirrors | `scripts/validate_version_governance.py` + `.github/workflows/governance-guard.yml` | `SOT.md`, Windows version metadata, package metadata | Canonical guard | Canonical version mirrors are now machine-checked on push, pull request, and manual workflow runs. |
| Security audit workflow | `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` | Python source and dependency audit evidence | Canonical guard | Bandit Medium/High findings fail CI. `pip-audit` runs against `requirements.txt` in advisory mode until the repo has a fully pinned/locked audit input. |
| Release tag boundary | `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` checks `tag == v{VERSION}` and release tag target == default-branch commit | GitHub release tags | Canonical boundary | Tags remain strict external SemVer, are machine-checked against `core/version.py`, and must resolve to the current default-branch commit before manifest publication. |
| Published manifest `latest.version` | `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` reads `core/version.py` | Hosted manifest consumers | Canonical | Published from canonical `VERSION`, not derived from tag parsing alone. |
| Published manifest signature | `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` runs `scripts/sign_manifest.py` | GitHub Actions release workflow | Canonical | Generated `stable.json` is signed into `stable.signed.json`; missing `BUSCORE_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` fails the workflow before upload. |
| Manifest public-key trust policy | `core/runtime/manifest_keys.py` | Core runtime verifier and release workflow verification step | Canonical | Production public key `bus-core-prod-ed25519-2026-04-25` is pinned in Core; private key must never be committed. |
| Update-check route contract | `core/api/routes/update.py` | UI Settings/update notice consumes this response | Canonical | Fixed six-field response. |
| Update manifest URL | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json` `updates.manifest_url` | `SOT.md` | Canonical | Code and docs use the Lighthouse endpoint. |
| Manifest `download_url` | `core/services/update.py` extracts and returns it | Compatibility field for check response | Canonical | `/app/update/check` stays read-only; staging uses manual `/app/update/stage`. |
| Staging manifest authenticity | `core/api/routes/update.py` + `core/services/update.py` + `core/runtime/manifest_trust.py` | Manual update staging | Canonical | `/app/update/stage` requires a signed manifest from an active pinned public key before artifact download/extract/EXE trust verification. |
| Manifest checksum / hash | `core/services/update_artifact.py` plus `core/runtime/update_cache.py` | Internal update cache helper | Canonical for staging | Internal download helper requires manifest-declared `sha256`, enforces `size_bytes` when present, verifies the cached ZIP bytes, and records `hash_verified` only after the staging path has selected a trusted signed manifest. |
| Safe extraction stage | `core/services/update_extract.py` plus `core/runtime/update_cache.py` | Internal update cache helper | Bridge groundwork | Internal extraction helper safely unpacks `hash_verified` ZIPs into `updates\versions\<version>\`, requires exactly one EXE candidate, and records `extracted` only. |
| EXE Authenticode / publisher verification | `core/services/update_exe_trust.py` plus `core/runtime/update_cache.py` | Internal update cache helper | Bridge groundwork | Internal EXE-trust helper verifies Windows Authenticode validity, True Good Craft signer-subject identity, and the pinned signer thumbprint `55474AA9A2D562022A6590D487045E069457F985`, then records `exe_verified` only. |
| Local update cache/state lifecycle | `core/runtime/update_cache.py` / update state model | Verified handoff prerequisite | Bridge groundwork | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\updates\` holds `manifests\`, `downloads\`, `versions\`, and `state.json`; live conservative stages are `hash_verified`, `extracted`, `exe_verified`, compatibility `verified_ready`, and version+sha keyed `verified_ready_versions`. |
| DB/app ownership lock | Launcher preflight plus app-level lock | Future verified handoff prerequisite | Canonical | Same DB/app root cannot have two live BUS Core owners. |
| Manifest channel selection | `core/config/update_policy.py` + `core/services/update.py` | Configured channel decides selected release entry | Canonical | Non-stable channels require explicit channel-specific entries and must not fall back to public latest. |

## Build and package outputs

| Output | Status | Produced by | Destination |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows one-file EXE | Canonical | `scripts/build_core.ps1` + `BUS-Core.spec` | `dist/BUS-Core.exe`, copied to `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.exe` |
| Canonical public release package (ZIP) | Canonical | `scripts/build_core.ps1 -Bundle` or `-Release`, then external release publication | `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip`; published release assets and mirrors remain outside the build script |
| Windows version metadata file | Canonical | `scripts/build_core.ps1` | `scripts/_win_version_info.txt` |
| Bundled UI/license assets | Canonical | `BUS-Core.spec` | Embedded in PyInstaller artifact |
| Docker image | Canonical | `Dockerfile`, `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml` | GHCR tags `latest` and `:<sha>` |
| Container runtime | Canonical | `docker-compose.yml` | Publishes `127.0.0.1:8765:8765` by default, persists `/data/app.db` |

## Observed Release Flow

1. `core/version.py` is the canonical public version source; runtime and build surfaces read strict SemVer `VERSION`.
2. `v1.2.0` is superseded by `v1.2.1` because the published Windows artifact was unsigned; do not mutate or reuse the `v1.2.0` release/tag/artifact for the corrected release.
3. The `v1.2.1` Windows EXE must be Authenticode-signed before packaging/uploading, and the update path must continue rejecting unsigned artifacts such as the `v1.2.0` artifact that failed with status `NotSigned`.
4. `scripts/build_core.ps1` reads `VERSION` from `core/version.py` unless an explicit override is passed, validates `X.Y.Z`, writes Windows version metadata, builds the one-file EXE, and copies `dist/BUS-Core.exe` to `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.exe`.
5. Without `-Sign`, `-Bundle`, or `-Release`, the script remains the normal build path and stops after the versioned EXE copy.
6. `scripts/build_core.ps1 -Release` now performs the local release build boundary: it builds the versioned EXE, signs only `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.exe`, verifies Authenticode validity and the signer thumbprint `55474AA9A2D562022A6590D487045E069457F985`, optionally verifies through `signtool`, and bundles `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip`.
7. The release ZIP is created from a clean staging folder and contains only the signed versioned EXE, `README.md`, and `license/` at the ZIP root.
8. The script does not store or automate signing passwords/PINs; any required credential entry remains in the Windows certificate-provider / `signtool` prompt flow.
9. GitHub release creation, Lighthouse/R2 mirroring, manifest signing, and manifest publication remain outside `scripts/build_core.ps1`.
10. `scripts/release-check.ps1` now validates the current release chain truthfully: isolated smoke, canonical build script, and artifact existence checks for both current EXE names.
11. `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` now separates tooling checkout from release identity: release-triggered runs still check out the published tag, while manual `workflow_dispatch` backfills may check out a current tooling ref such as `main` and mirror an older `release_tag` independently.
12. For published releases, the workflow fetches full history and fails unless the release tag resolves to the checked-out commit and the current default-branch commit. This prevents publishing a release tag from an older commit after the version bump or release-hygiene commits were left behind.
13. For published releases, the workflow still reads `VERSION` from `core/version.py` and fails unless the release tag exactly equals `v{VERSION}`. For manual backfills, it validates the requested `release_tag` as strict `vX.Y.Z`, derives manifest `latest.version` and expected asset name from that requested tag, and uses the same tag for release download and release notes URL generation.
14. The same workflow downloads the exact `BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip` release asset, computes `sha256`, uploads the asset to R2 `releases/<asset-name>`, and generates manifest `latest.version` plus an authoritative absolute `latest.download.url` using `https://lighthouse.buscore.ca/releases/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip`.
15. Before signing, the workflow now prints the working directory, lists `scripts/`, and fails clearly if `scripts/sign_manifest.py` is missing from the checked-out tooling ref. It then signs generated `stable.json` into `stable.signed.json` with `scripts/sign_manifest.py`, key ID `bus-core-prod-ed25519-2026-04-25`, and GitHub secret `BUSCORE_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`. If that secret is missing, the workflow fails clearly and does not silently publish an unsigned manifest.
16. The workflow verifies that the signed manifest preserves `latest.version` and `latest.download.url`, contains `signature.alg = Ed25519` and the expected key ID, and verifies the embedded signature using Core's pinned public key policy before upload.
17. The signed manifest is uploaded in place to R2 as `manifest/core/stable.json`. Lighthouse serves/proxies that manifest, but Lighthouse does not own signing authority; the GitHub Actions release workflow does.
18. `.github/workflows/publish-image.yml` remains a separate container-publish workflow and does not govern Windows release/update version authority.

## Docker Deployment Boundary

BUS Core is local-first software. The default Docker Compose runtime publishes the app to host loopback only with `127.0.0.1:8765:8765`; the container-internal Uvicorn bind remains `0.0.0.0` so Docker networking works. BUS Core is not safe for LAN or public exposure by default because `/session/token` is a local bootstrap surface and the default session model is for local loopback use, not multi-user network hosting.

Any non-loopback deployment requires explicit operator action, a clearly named override such as `docker-compose.lan.yml`, and stronger access controls around the host, network, reverse proxy, and session bootstrap path. Bare default host publishing such as `8765:8765` is not permitted in `docker-compose.yml`.

This flow is trustworthy to the extent that version authority is singular and machine-checked, release manifests are signed, and manual staging now fails closed on unsigned or untrusted manifest metadata. It is not yet a fully automated end-to-end updater, and the docs should not imply otherwise.

Manifest compatibility is a release boundary for this bridge release: deployed clients must still find top-level `latest.version` and `latest.download.url`, while newer clients may additionally read additive metadata, `channels.<channel>` entries, and a top-level embedded `signature`. `channels.stable` should mirror top-level `latest` unless a release owner intentionally documents a divergence. The embedded signature covers deterministic canonical JSON of the manifest after removing top-level `signature`.

## Observed Update Check Flow

1. UI startup notice or Settings `Check now` calls `GET /app/update/check`.
2. Startup gating happens in the UI using `updates.enabled !== false` and `updates.check_on_startup !== false`; manual `Check now` still calls the route regardless of those two gates.
3. Route loads the configured `updates.channel` and `updates.manifest_url` from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json`.
4. `UpdateService.check()` validates the current runtime version as strict SemVer.
5. Service validates the manifest URL and configured channel, fetches JSON with timeout and size caps, normalizes supported manifest shapes, supports signed manifest unwrapping when present, validates optional metadata shape, and compares the selected release version against runtime `VERSION`. Read-only update check still preserves unsigned-manifest compatibility.
   - The outbound check request appends three aggregate-safe query params to the manifest URL: `current_version` (runtime `VERSION`, omitted if not strict SemVer), `channel` (validated low-cardinality lane, falling back to `stable`), and `first_check` (`true` on the first version-aware check for this local profile, `false` thereafter). Any pre-existing query params on `updates.manifest_url` are preserved; the app-provided values win on key collision. No identity is ever added — no install/device/user id, hostname, username, machine fingerprint, or dedupe/persistent-client token. The `first_check` state is a single local boolean `update_check_first_reported` in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json`, set after the request attempt finishes (even on error) so a flaky network cannot inflate first-seen counts.
6. Route returns normalized response keys: `current_version`, `latest_version`, `update_available`, `download_url`, `error_code`, `error_message`.
7. UI shows a manual Update button when `update_available` is true.
8. Clicking Update calls `POST /app/update/stage` (auth + write-gated) which requires a trusted signed manifest, then performs hash-verified ZIP download, safe extraction, EXE trust verification, and conservative version+sha keyed `verified_ready_versions` promotion. Legacy `verified_ready` remains only a compatibility/latest pointer.
9. Successful staging reports verified-ready state and instructs restart/reopen; no forced restart endpoint is invoked.
10. On next start, launcher evaluates all `verified_ready_versions` records after DB lock, filters to versions newer than the running `VERSION`, selects the newest eligible SemVer candidate, and applies verified launch policy without overwriting the running EXE.

Update checks are part of the trust model because they are optional and non-blocking. Core remains usable without them, and an unavailable manifest host should not prevent normal local operation.

## Implemented vs documented vs assumed release/update elements

| Element | Implemented in code | Documented only | Assumed by tooling | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## External infrastructure references

| Reference | Status | Where it appears | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `https://lighthouse.buscore.ca/update/check` | Canonical | `core/config/manager.py` default updates config, `SOT.md` | Current default update endpoint. |
| `https://buscore.ca` | Secondary | `README.md` | Public site reference only. |
| GHCR `ghcr.io/true-good-craft/tgc-bus-core` | Canonical | README + publish workflow | Container distribution path. |

## Fragile coupling points

| Coupling point | Status | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core/version.py` vs docs/governance text | Secondary | Runtime/build/workflow truth is canonical in code; human docs must stay in sync. |
| `scripts/release-check.ps1` vs actual smoke/build chain | Canonical | Helper now validates the real current scripts and artifact names. |
| Governance guard workflow bypass | Narrowed drift | General automation remains sparse, but version and change-trace governance now fail through an active dedicated workflow. |
| Update check and stage split | Canonical | `/app/update/check` is read-only; `/app/update/stage` is manual and write-gated to execute trusted staging. |
| Release history in manifest | Narrowed drift | Current release publication is canonical, but history still reflects GitHub release metadata filtered by canonical `BUS-Core-*.zip` assets. |
| Manifest signing key custody | Canonical but operational | Private key lives outside repo in GitHub secret `BUSCORE_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`; public key is pinned in Core. |

Release and update trust here depends more on clear authority and honest limits than on a large automation footprint. The current boundary is: canonical version authority exists, authority mirrors and change-trace requirements are machine-checked, tag alignment is checked, manifests are signed during release publication, update-check metadata is normalized, channel-specific manifests are selected explicitly, manual staging requires trusted signed manifest metadata before executing artifact verification into version+sha keyed `verified_ready_versions`, and launcher handoff is policy-controlled on next start.

Known remaining release/update work is explicit: deciding whether read-only update check should also require signed manifests, adding optional restart orchestration beyond restart/reopen guidance, and Docker release hardening if the container lane needs governed releases. There is still no auto-install, startup auto-update, telemetry, or silent background update behavior.

## Freeze Notes

- Refresh on: version bumps, build script/spec changes, update-service changes, manifest URL changes, workflow changes, or signing/validation changes.
- Fastest invalidators: changing the canonical version source, changing release asset naming, weakening staging signed-manifest enforcement, disabling security-audit workflow evidence, adding new artifact trust stages, or rewriting release publication flow.
- Check alongside: `02_API_AND_UI_CONTRACT_MAP.md` for `/app/update/check` contract shape and `04_SECURITY_TRUST_AND_OPERATIONS.md` for update-path security implications.

## Internal Version Boundary

- `VERSION` remains the only value allowed into release tags, published manifest `latest.version`, and update comparison logic.
- `INTERNAL_VERSION` is for repo working-revision tracking only.
- `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` now machine-checks `tag == v{VERSION}` before publishing release metadata.
- Remaining unresolved drift is narrow and explicit: manifests are signed during release publication, staging requires a trusted signed manifest, read-only update check still keeps unsigned compatibility; metadata may be published and retained as declared values; manual `/app/update/stage` executes trusted ZIP hash/extract/EXE verification into `verified_ready_versions`; and release history still depends on GitHub release metadata plus matching BUS-Core assets.

## Manifest Key Rotation

- Add the new production public key to `core/runtime/manifest_keys.py` as active.
- Publish manifests signed with the new key ID after clients have the new public key.
- Mark the old key deprecated while older clients migrate.
- Revoke or remove the old key only after supported clients trust the replacement.
