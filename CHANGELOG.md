# Changelog

## [1.3.2] - 2026-06-20

### LazoralltheCore / Laser Everything Community Polish Patch

- Completed the Laser Everything/community feedback polish pass without expanding Core into new product domains.
- Clarified Product, Recipe, and Output Item/Output Product wording across the first inventory-to-manufacturing workflow.
- Updated Stock Out so sale price starts from the selected product price where available, shows the usual price, and warns non-blockingly below the usual price.
- Made manufacturing and stock-out shortages human-readable with item names and need/have/missing quantities.
- Displayed manufacturing history labels as `Run #N` and added common Finance date presets.
- Strengthened Start Fresh and demo safety copy so operators know demo data is separate and real-shop data should be backed up first.
- Added `vendor_id` to item responses for reliable item-form vendor preservation and rejected negative Stock Out sale unit prices.

### Reliability and Test Closure

- Fixed backup/restore SQLite URI handling for Windows paths containing spaces or `#`, with export/preview/commit regression coverage.
- Reconciled the intentionally hardened `/dev/writes` CORS/session test contract without changing runtime auth, CORS, local-only, or write-gate behavior.
- Fixed route/security test isolation so module reloads and synthetic FastAPI app state no longer make combined security suites order-dependent.

### Release and Stability Boundary

- Bumped public `VERSION` from `1.3.1` to `1.3.2` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.3.1.1` to `1.3.2.0` for the owner-approved public release boundary.
- Updated package metadata, Windows version metadata, SOT header, shell asset cache-busting tokens, Home's Latest Update card, and official release notes for expected tag `v1.3.2`.
- Core is now feature-frozen and stability-focused. It remains maintained local-first, open-source infrastructure with no forced cloud and no telemetry.
- Future Core updates will focus on bug fixes, safety, security/trust, backup and data protection, tester blockers, update/release reliability, small UX clarification, and documentation. New major workflow or domain expansion moves to BUS Pro discovery.
- Still not included: full POS, full accounting, QuickBooks/Wave sync, automatic reorder, full job scheduling, cloud accounts, cloud sync, telemetry, payment links, customer portals, or recurring billing.

### Operator Wiki Documentation

- Expanded the BUS Core Wiki with operator-focused getting-started, first-shop workflow, inventory, recipes, manufacturing, Finance, backup/restore, local-first trust, updates, troubleshooting, and product-boundary guidance.
- Cross-linked the Wiki around the verified v1.3.2 material-to-product workflow and replaced stale draft wording without changing runtime, API, security, update, backup/restore, or data behavior.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.3.2.0` to `1.3.2.1` for the documentation trace while leaving public `VERSION` at `1.3.2`.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-18

### Release Guard Fix

- Bumped public `VERSION` from `1.3.0` to `1.3.1` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.3.0.1` to `1.3.1.0` after the failed `v1.3.0` release tag was created from a commit that still reported `VERSION = "1.2.4"`.
- Updated package metadata, Windows version metadata, SOT header, shell CSS/JS cache-busting tokens, and GitHub release notes for `v1.3.1`.
- Hardened `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` so published release runs fetch full history and fail unless the release tag resolves to the checked-out commit and the current default-branch commit before any mirror/upload work starts.
- Extended version-drift tests to require the release-mirror workflow's default-branch/tag-target guard and explicit repair guidance.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-18

### Invoice Truth MVP

- Added local invoice authority in Core with DB-backed invoices and invoice lines, additive startup schema materialization, invoice permissions, and focused API coverage.
- Added canonical invoice API routes under `/app/invoices` for listing, creating, updating drafts, adding/updating/deleting draft lines, issuing, marking paid, voiding, and reading invoice detail.
- Added local printable invoice HTML at `/app/invoices/{invoice_id}/print` for browser print or save-to-PDF workflows without adding a PDF dependency.
- Added a dedicated `#/invoices` screen with list/detail workflow, manual draft invoice creation, tax-rate and taxable-line controls, totals display, status badges, issue/mark-paid/void actions, and print access.
- Added a Jobs action that creates a draft invoice from a job and opens it directly in the invoice editor.
- Added invoice read/write permissions and route guard coverage so claimed-mode navigation and backend permission checks stay aligned.
- Preserved the local-first scope: no email sending, payment links, customer portal, accounting sync, recurring billing, reminders, or Pro automation were added.

### Theme Variants Spike

- Added a UI-only theme manager in `core/ui/js/theme.js` using localStorage key `bus.ui.themeVariant`.
- Reused the existing Settings theme dropdown as the single theme selector and added four variants: BUS Core Default / Forge Dark, Clean Light, Workshop Slate, and High Contrast.
- Applied themes through `document.documentElement.dataset.busTheme` / `data-bus-theme` and CSS variables, with startup bootstrap to minimize first-paint flicker.
- Preserved backward compatibility for legacy theme values: `dark`, `system`, `current`, and `default` map to Forge Dark; `light` maps to Clean Light.
- Kept the current Forge Dark appearance as the default and avoided duplicate theme switchers, backend config changes, telemetry, CDNs, or asset changes for the theme spike.

### Release Hygiene

- Bumped public `VERSION` from `1.2.4` to `1.3.0` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.2.4.3` to `1.3.0.0` for the combined Invoice Truth MVP and UI theme release boundary.
- Updated package and Windows version metadata mirrors to `1.3.0`.
- Updated Home's Latest Update card, README feature framing, API/UI contract docs, SOT version header, and generated GitHub release notes for `v1.3.0`.
- Removed the accidentally tracked vendored GitHub CLI files from `.tools/` and ignored `.tools/` for future local tooling.
- Added the Invoices sidebar icon mapping and release-tree icon asset.
- Added UI cache-busting for the native launcher, root/UI redirects, shell CSS/JS asset URLs, and `/ui/*` response headers so browser tabs fetch the current frontend after an app update without requiring a manual hard reload.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.3.0.0` to `1.3.0.1` for the browser cache-busting release fix without changing public `VERSION`.

## [1.2.4] - 2026-06-17

### Jobs Workflow Polish

- Hardened Jobs line entry so service and fee quantity defaults use `ea`, invalid UOM values are blocked, backend line quantity failures return stable validation codes, and the UI shows actionable validation messages instead of raw request failures.
- Fixed desktop shell scroll ownership so `#main` is the primary scroll container and the document body does not create a competing vertical scrollbar at browser zoom levels such as 125%.
- Added a minimal Jobs-local contact quick-create flow that uses the existing Contacts facade, selects the new contact for unsaved jobs, and links it immediately for existing jobs.
- Added a stronger Home-screen Discord call-to-action under Support Development and gave the Jobs sidebar tab a dedicated icon that matches the existing nav treatment.
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.2.3` to `1.2.4` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.2.3.4` to `1.2.4.0` for the owner-approved release boundary.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-06-01

### Home Release Polish

- Polished the Home screen for the public release with a clearer alert strip, focused Shop Bench, separate Jobs Pressure board, and right-side System Trust, Latest Update, Support Development, and Help & Community sections.
- Added operator-facing Home links for support, docs, bug reports, Discord, license, data safety, known limits, and the full changelog without changing local-first data authority.
- Included Job Tracking Phase 1 and Phase 2 in the release boundary: additive Jobs backend tables/APIs, the `#/jobs` operator screen, and a read-only Home Jobs Pressure board with no stock, cash, manufacturing, or quantity-conversion side effects.
- Refreshed claimed-mode role defaults through `/auth/state` so existing owner/operator/viewer roles pick up Jobs permissions and authorized users keep the Jobs sidebar item after SPA auth boot.
- `scripts/build_core.ps1` release mode now supports signing and bundling in addition to the existing one-file build path.
- `scripts/build_core.ps1 -Release` builds `dist/BUS-Core-1.2.3.exe`, signs the versioned EXE, verifies Authenticode validity and signer thumbprint `55474AA9A2D562022A6590D487045E069457F985`, verifies the timestamped signature, and creates the canonical release ZIP `dist/BUS-Core-1.2.3.zip`.
- The canonical `BUS-Core-1.2.3.zip` release bundle contains only `BUS-Core-1.2.3.exe`, `README.md`, and `license/` at the ZIP root.
- No signing password or PIN is stored in the repo or script; the operator enters any required credential through the Windows certificate provider / signing prompt flow.
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.2.2` to `1.2.3` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.2.2.3` to `1.2.3.0` for the owner-approved public release boundary.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Fixed Add Item regression coverage for weight-based units of measure such as `mg`, `g`, and `kg`, including filament-style gram stock-in to canonical `mg` base units.
- Fixed update checks being blocked by the claimed-mode login gate by making exact `GET /app/update/check` public while keeping protected `/app` routes private.
- Re-enabled the one-shot automatic update check through the public read-only check path so login boot does not request a legacy session token or `/app/config` before authentication.
- Removed the defunct Home transaction widget so claimed-mode login no longer triggers pre-auth `/app/transactions*` requests.

### Changed

- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.2.1` to `1.2.2` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.2.1.1` to `1.2.2.0` for the owner-approved scoped hotfix release boundary.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- Supersedes `v1.2.0`; the `v1.2.0` release/tag/artifact must not be reused for the corrected Windows release artifact.
- No major product feature delta from `v1.2.0` is intended; this release exists to replace the unsigned `v1.2.0` Windows artifact with a properly signed release artifact.
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.2.0` to `1.2.1` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.2.0.0` to `1.2.1.0` for the corrected release boundary.

### Security / Update Safety

- The updater correctly rejected the unsigned `v1.2.0` Windows artifact with Authenticode status `NotSigned`.
- The signature validation guard remains active and must not be bypassed; unsigned update artifacts must continue to fail closed.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Fixed cached update handoff when BUS Core is already running from a previously staged verified update.
- Multiple `verified_ready` update artifacts can now coexist safely in version+sha keyed cache state.
- Manual staging now checks the exact manifest latest version and `sha256` before returning `already_ready`, instead of treating any ready artifact as sufficient.
- Launcher handoff now scans verified-ready records, filters to versions newer than the running `VERSION`, and chooses the newest eligible SemVer version.
- Running executables are not overwritten or deleted during update staging, and older verified-ready cached versions do not block newer updates.

### Changed
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.1.1` to `1.2.0` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.15` to `1.2.0.0` for the verified update-cache handoff release, reflecting the complexity of the cache-state and launcher-handoff changes.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-24

### Changed
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.0.3` to `1.0.4`
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.3.3` to `1.0.4.0`

## [1.0.3] - Previous Release
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.0.2` to `1.0.3`

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.14` to `1.1.1.15` for the recovery UI entry-point patch without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added minimal claimed-mode recovery UI: login now exposes a recovery form for the existing `/auth/recover` backend route, validates password confirmation client-side, shows generic recovery failures, and returns to login with a success message without storing recovery data.
- Added Security UI recovery-code regeneration for users with management authority, using the existing `/auth/recovery-codes/regenerate` backend route, warning before invalidating old unused codes, showing new codes once, and clearing them after confirmation.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.13` to `1.1.1.14` for release-blocker hardening without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added owner recovery and recovery-code regeneration API behavior: recovery codes remain long-lived until used/regenerated, are stored only as hashes, burn on successful use, revoke existing sessions, require login after reset, write audit events, and use generic recovery failure responses with DB-backed failed-attempt rate limiting.
- Hardened auth sessions with explicit 12-hour idle timeout, 30-day max age, and throttled `last_seen_at` touch behavior.
- Updated the Security UI to refresh in-memory auth state after permission/session-sensitive management actions and handle `401`/`403` responses without storing authority in browser storage.
- Fixed duplicate OpenAPI operation IDs for the logs route and added an OpenAPI schema uniqueness regression test.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.12` to `1.1.1.13` for the Phase 7 auth/security hardening and release-readiness audit without changing public `VERSION`.
- Hardened auth/user-account release readiness with an explicit minimum password length, route-level password-policy errors, expanded cookie/session/permission/owner-invariant/UI-storage tests, and an OS-stable UI contract audit that keeps legacy endpoint and canonical-containment guardrails active with documented allowlists for known compatibility code.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.11` to `1.1.1.12` for the Phase 6 claim/login/logout and Security UI pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added frontend auth boot, owner-claim, recovery-code display, login/logout, current-user chrome, permission-aware navigation hiding, and `#/security` user/session/audit management UI on top of the existing backend auth APIs while preserving unclaimed local mode and avoiding localStorage auth authority.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.10` to `1.1.1.11` for the Phase 5 claimed-mode user, role, session, and audit management API without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added the backend-only `/app/users`, `/app/roles`, `/app/sessions`, and `/app/audit` management surface with route-local `users.read`, `users.manage`, `sessions.manage`, and `audit.read` permissions, write gates on mutations, last-enabled-owner invariant enforcement, session revocation for disabled/reset users, and audit events for user/session management actions.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.9` to `1.1.1.10` for the Phase 4 route-local claimed-mode permission dependency pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added claimed-mode route-local permission dependencies for covered protected route families, including inventory/items, ledger/stock, recipes, manufacturing, vendors/contacts, finance, logs, config/update/system, backup/import/export, and practical sensitive utility routes while preserving unclaimed-mode legacy local behavior and existing write/owner gates.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.8` to `1.1.1.9` for the Phase 3 claimed-mode global auth gate cutover without changing public `VERSION`.
- Cut over the global HTTP auth gate so unclaimed mode preserves legacy local `bus_session` behavior, claimed mode requires valid DB-backed `bus_auth_session` for protected routes, `/session/token` returns `login_required` in claimed mode, and bootstrap auth routes stay reachable without adding UI, user-management routes, route-local permissions, default users, or business-logic changes.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.7` to `1.1.1.8` for the Phase 2 auth account-lifecycle route surface without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added DB-backed `/auth/state`, `/auth/setup-owner`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, and `/auth/me` routes with owner setup, login/logout session creation/revocation, one-time recovery-code generation/storage-by-hash, and auth audit events while leaving `session_guard`, `/session/token`, existing `/app/*` permissions, UI, and default-user creation unchanged.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.6` to `1.1.1.7` for the Phase 1 DB-backed auth schema and low-level service skeleton without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added auth/user-account ORM tables and pure helper modules for future claimed/unclaimed auth while leaving `/session/token`, session middleware, route permissions, UI, and default-user creation unchanged.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.5` to `1.1.1.6` for the Phase 0 auth/user accounts governance authorization pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Authorized the planned local-first user account model in governance docs: zero-user unclaimed mode, one-or-more-user claimed mode, no default usable admin, one-way owner setup, DB-backed auth state, route-local auditable permissions, last-enabled-owner invariants, recovery-code rules, and claimed-mode audit expectations.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.4` to `1.1.1.5` for Patch 1D test write-gate AppData isolation without changing public `VERSION`.
- Isolated the shared API test client `LOCALAPPDATA` under pytest temp directories so write-gate setup/teardown cannot mutate the user's real `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json`.
- Added regression coverage proving a sentinel real AppData config remains unchanged while the isolated test config receives `dev.writes_enabled` updates.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.3` to `1.1.1.4` for Patch 1C purchase truth and finance export UI wiring without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added Inventory UI wiring to record purchases through `/app/purchase` using canonical `quantity_decimal` + `uom` fields, purchase category, and optional notes while keeping Add Batch as a separate stock-in action.
- Added Finance UI CSV export through `/app/finance/export.csv?profile=generic` using the active date range, with no accounting OAuth, account mapping, item import, or schema changes.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.2` to `1.1.1.3` for Patch 1B finance CSV export backend support without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added read-only `/app/finance/export.csv` for generic CAD finance CSV export using existing cash and legacy inferred purchase truth.
- Kept the finance export backend-only with no accounting OAuth, account mapping, item import, or schema column/table changes.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.1` to `1.1.1.2` for Patch 1A purchase truth backend foundation without changing public `VERSION`.
- Made `/app/purchase` emit cash-backed purchase expense events linked to inventory batches/movements by shared `source_id`, while keeping legacy movement-only purchase history visible as `purchase_inferred`.
- Added idempotent source-id lookup indexes for purchase transaction deduplication without adding schema columns or tables.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.1.0` to `1.1.1.1` for the wiki publishing/docs pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `VERSION` from `1.1.0` to `1.1.1` and reset `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.14` to `1.1.1.0` for the next governed update cut.

### Fixed
- Removed import-time diagnostic prints from runtime modules and narrowed item price-decimal fallback handling without changing API contracts.
- Remediated documented empty exception handlers with narrow catches, safe type-only journal logging, controlled secret-delete failures, and explicit non-fatal intent comments.
- Removed confirmed unused imports across core modules, scripts, plugins, and tests without changing runtime behavior.
- Shaped remaining import preview, import commit, and transform simulation responses to suppress raw exception/debug/path detail, and set CI workflow permissions to explicit read-only contents access.
- Hardened Organizer duplicate scanning and rename planning so start paths, quarantine destinations, walked files, and generated names must resolve under configured local filesystem roots before filesystem access.
- Reduced exception-detail exposure in protected plan commit/export, restore commit, and dev diagnostic responses by returning controlled error codes instead of raw exception strings.
- Tightened the shared safe-path helper so untrusted input rejects `~`, traversal segments, UNC/device prefixes, and drive-relative forms before concrete path construction, while keeping explicit allowed-root containment as the final authority check.
- Hardened sandbox transform execution so subprocess argv is fixed to BUS Core-owned arguments only and dynamic transform data is passed through stdin JSON with controlled malformed-request handling.
- Hardened the legacy compatibility router so route dispatch is allowlisted and prototype-safe, with unknown or malicious-looking routes falling back safely to `/home`.
- Replaced admin restore/import preview `innerHTML` rendering with text-safe DOM construction so preview metadata is rendered as text rather than reinterpreted as markup.
- Added shared safe path resolution for import/export, local-open, local-validate, and plugin UI asset paths so user-controlled path values must resolve under explicit allowed roots before filesystem or OS-open use.
- Fixed Manufacturing stock display so recipe input/output rows show current on-hand inventory values instead of `—`.
- Aligned Manufacturing stock rendering with Inventory's item display helper.
- Fixed item-entry workflow so adding a vendor from the item form preserves current item fields.
- Added in-form vendor creation flow that returns to the item form and selects the newly created vendor.

### Added
- Added GitHub Sponsors funding metadata and documented BUS Core support links in the README and transparency docs.
- Added a `/wiki` user-help skeleton for beta/setup/operator guidance and `.github/workflows/publish-wiki.yml` to publish that folder to the GitHub Wiki on `main` pushes touching wiki content.
- Added a swallowed-exception governance policy and source guard test that rejects undocumented empty exception handlers.
- Added `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml` with Bandit source scanning, Medium/High Bandit CI failure, Low-severity advisory reporting, and advisory `pip-audit` evidence against `requirements.txt`.
- Added tracked governance summary for the completed security hardening pass: route-local guard consistency, Docker loopback default, loopback-only CORS, signed-manifest update staging, active security-audit workflow, and the local post-hardening OWASP 2025 reassessment. The OWASP report itself remains a local ignored report and is not release evidence on its own.
- Added explicit remaining-work framing for security governance: structured security audit events, dependency lockfile / blocking dependency audit, backup/restore safeguards, fallback secrets hardening, plugin/provider trust boundaries, and no LAN/public/multi-user hosting claim.
- Added update-staging signature-enforcement tests covering unsigned, trusted signed, bad-signature, unknown-key, explicit unsigned opt-out, and unchanged read-only update-check behavior.
- Added a focused CORS loopback policy test that source-checks the FastAPI middleware configuration and verifies allowed loopback, rejected untrusted-origin, no-wildcard, and same-origin unaffected behavior.
- Added a Docker loopback binding governance test that fails if default Compose publishing regresses to bare `8765:8765` and allows LAN exposure only in explicitly named, documented unsafe/advanced override files.
- Added route-guard consistency regression coverage for scoped ledger, finance, config, update, and app-log routes, including source-level mutation/read guard checks plus anonymous and writes-disabled API checks.
- Added secure-update foundation documentation for the post-v1.0.4 bridge work: DB/app ownership locking, local update cache/state scaffolding, Ed25519 manifest trust primitives, embedded backward-compatible manifest signatures, the pinned production manifest public-key policy, the release-side `scripts/sign_manifest.py` helper, and release-mirror manifest signing before upload.
- Added `scripts/validate_version_governance.py` to machine-check `pyproject.toml`, `SOT.md`, and `scripts/_win_version_info.txt` against the canonical values in `core/version.py`.
- Added `scripts/validate_change_trace.py`, `scripts/governance-check.ps1`, and `.github/workflows/governance-guard.yml` so code/control-surface changes fail hard unless `CHANGELOG.md` and `core/version.py` are part of the same change set.
- Added fortheemperor UI authority freeze documentation capturing canonical UI styling authority, active module standardization status, completed parity remediation scope, and deferred follow-on work.
- Added config-authority drift guards that assert `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json` is the canonical app-runtime config file, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\app\config.json` is legacy compatibility input only, and startup/write-policy code follows that contract.
- Added targeted config behavior tests for canonical write-gate persistence, canonical policy persistence, and one-way legacy fallback reads.
- Added release/update drift guards that verify release tooling reads `core/version.py`, targets the canonical public `BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip` artifact name, and keeps `INTERNAL_VERSION` out of public SemVer consumers.
- Added auth-authority drift guards that verify `core.api.http` remains the canonical validator path, `tgc.security.require_token_ctx` is compatibility-only, and the authority docs stay aligned.
- Added update channel/config hardening for the manual update-check path: allowed channels are `stable`, `test`, `partner-3dque`, `lts-1.1`, and `security-hotfix`; missing channel defaults to `stable`; unsafe manifest URL schemes and local/private manifest hosts remain rejected outside explicit dev mode.
- Added manifest schema validation for supported legacy, canonical `latest`, `channels.<channel>`, and top-level channel-keyed manifest shapes while preserving the six-field `/app/update/check` response.
- Added internal `ManifestRelease` metadata carry-forward so validated manifest-provided `sha256`, `size_bytes`, release notes, signature URL, artifact kind/type/platform, publisher, and signer fields can be retained as declared metadata for future verification work.
- Added an internal update-artifact download helper that caches release ZIPs under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\updates\downloads\`, requires manifest-declared `sha256`, enforces `size_bytes` when present, verifies the downloaded ZIP hash against signed manifest metadata, and records `hash_verified` state only.
- Added a safe ZIP extraction helper that unpacks `hash_verified` artifacts into `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\updates\versions\<version>\` via a temporary extraction directory, rejects zip-slip / absolute-path / escaping / suspicious ZIP entries, requires exactly one `.exe` candidate, and records `extracted` state only.
- Added Windows EXE trust verification for extracted update artifacts: the verifier requires Authenticode `Status == Valid`, True Good Craft signer-subject matching, and the pinned production signer thumbprint `55474AA9A2D562022A6590D487045E069457F985`, then records conservative `exe_verified` state only.
- Added a narrow `verified_ready` promotion helper that writes `verified_ready` only when `hash_verified`, `extracted`, and `exe_verified` all agree on version/channel/hash/path data and the cached ZIP, extracted version directory, and extracted EXE still exist inside the confined update-cache roots.

### Changed

- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.10` to `1.1.0.11` for the remaining information-exposure and CI workflow-permissions hardening pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.9` to `1.1.0.10` for the Organizer path-injection hardening pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.8` to `1.1.0.9` for the information-exposure hardening pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.7` to `1.1.0.8` for the shared path-sanitizer follow-up hardening pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.6` to `1.1.0.7` for the pre-PR security hardening governance/docs pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.5` to `1.1.0.6` for the Manufacturing/Inventory UI correctness patch without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.4` to `1.1.0.5` for security-tooling workflow governance without changing public `VERSION`.
- Required signed manifests for the default `/app/update/stage` service path while leaving read-only `/app/update/check` unsigned-manifest compatibility unchanged.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.3` to `1.1.0.4` for update-staging signed-manifest enforcement without changing public `VERSION`.
- Restricted default FastAPI CORS from wildcard origins/methods to explicit loopback origins and explicit methods/headers, aligning browser-origin policy with BUS Core's local-first trust model.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.2` to `1.1.0.3` for CORS loopback restriction without changing public `VERSION`.
- Hardened Docker Compose default exposure to publish BUS Core on host loopback only (`127.0.0.1:8765:8765`) while preserving the container-internal Uvicorn bind, and updated runtime/security/release docs to state LAN/public exposure is unsafe by default.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.1` to `1.1.0.2` for Docker loopback exposure hardening without changing public `VERSION`.
- Added explicit route-local session-token dependencies to sensitive ledger, finance, config, update-check, and app-log reads; added explicit route-local token + write-gate dependencies to ledger, finance, config, and update-stage mutations without changing payload contracts or public `VERSION`.
- Reconciled stale `pyproject.toml` and `SOT.md` public-version mirrors to the existing canonical `VERSION` value `1.1.0` from `core/version.py`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.1.0.0` to `1.1.0.1` for the route-local guard consistency patch without changing public `VERSION`.
- Sidebar update UX now uses a manual `Update` button instead of a raw download link as the primary action; it calls `POST /app/update/stage` only on user click, shows in-progress status, and reports verified-ready restart guidance without forcing restart.
- Updated security/release docs (`README.md`, `04_SECURITY_TRUST_AND_OPERATIONS.md`, `05_RELEASE_UPDATE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_FLOW.md`) to reflect current behavior accurately: `/app/update/check` remains read-only, manual `/app/update/stage` performs trusted staging, launcher policy-based handoff occurs after DB lock on next start, and there is no overwrite, forced restart, or startup auto-stage.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.4.4` to `1.0.4.5` for the EXE trust, `verified_ready`, and targeted governance/docs pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.4.2` to `1.0.4.3` for the release-mirror tooling separation and manifest-signing script import-path hardening without changing public `VERSION`.
- Updated `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` to separate tooling checkout (`tooling_ref`) from release identity (`release_tag`), enabling manual `workflow_dispatch` backfills to use current signing tooling while mirroring historical releases like `v1.0.4`.
- Added `workflow_dispatch` inputs `release_tag` and `tooling_ref` to release-mirror workflow; `release_tag` specifies the historical release to mirror, `tooling_ref` (default: `main`) specifies the repo ref to checkout for current `scripts/sign_manifest.py` and other tooling.
- Added pre-sign debug step to release-mirror workflow that verifies `scripts/sign_manifest.py` exists before signing, failing with a clear error message if the checked-out `tooling_ref` is missing the signing script.
- Added PYTHONPATH environment variable to release-mirror signing step to ensure core module imports resolve correctly in GitHub Actions.
- Added repo-root sys.path bootstrap to `scripts/sign_manifest.py` so it can be run directly from shell or CI without requiring PYTHONPATH to be preset, allowing `from core.runtime.manifest_trust import ...` to succeed.
- Updated `05_RELEASE_UPDATE_AND_DEPLOYMENT_FLOW.md` release-flow documentation to reflect that manual `workflow_dispatch` backfills validate `release_tag` as strict `vX.Y.Z` and derive manifest versioning from that requested tag instead of from the checked-out tooling ref.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.4.1` to `1.0.4.2` for the secure-update foundation governance/signing-pipeline alignment pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Documented that the release mirror now signs generated `stable.json` into `stable.signed.json` with `BUSCORE_MANIFEST_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, verifies backward-compatible `latest.version` / `latest.download.url` plus Ed25519 signature metadata, verifies against Core's pinned public key policy, and publishes the signed manifest in place as `manifest/core/stable.json`.
- Clarified secure-update limits: read-only update-check unsigned compatibility remains available, manual update staging now requires trusted signed manifests, internal helpers support hash-verified ZIP download, safe extraction, EXE Authenticode/publisher/thumbprint verification, and conservative `verified_ready` promotion inside the local update cache, but there is still no forced restart or auto-apply behavior.
- Added launcher-level DB ownership preflight so duplicate native launches are rejected before migrations, server bind, or browser open while retaining the app-level startup guard for server-only entrypoints.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.4.0` to `1.0.4.1` for the DB ownership/single-instance launcher hardening without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.3.2` to `1.0.3.3` for the final pre-release update-hardening governance pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Corrected release mirror asset naming authority from `TGC-BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip` to `BUS-Core-<VERSION>.zip` so release download, R2 mirror path, and manifest `latest.download.url` naming are aligned with the canonical artifact convention.
- Documented this release as an update-chain hardening bridge release: manifest compatibility is preserved for existing clients using top-level `latest.version` and `latest.download.url`, while new clients can consume channel-aware/additive metadata.
- Hardened non-stable update channel behavior so partner/test/LTS/security-hotfix lanes require explicit channel entries and do not silently fall back to public channel-less stable/latest manifests.
- Hardened manifest metadata handling so optional `sha256`, `size_bytes`, `release_notes_url`, `signature_url`, artifact token fields, publisher, and signer metadata are validated for shape when present and retained internally as declared values only.
- Restored the API error-code contract for blocked localhost/private/link-local/loopback/unspecified manifest URLs: policy-denied hosts return `manifest_url_not_allowed`, while malformed URLs and bad schemes remain `invalid_manifest_url`.
- Documented Phase 0A update-check behavior correction: update checks are default-on / opt-out, startup checks are one-shot and gated by `updates.enabled !== false` plus `updates.check_on_startup !== false`, manual "Check now" remains available, and hidden 15-minute polling/localStorage stale tracking has been removed.
- Corrected release-pipeline documentation to state current limits plainly: BUS Core does not auto-download/install/stage updates, does not verify artifact hash/signature/publisher/size yet, code signing remains manual post-build, release automation publishes the stable lane only, and Docker images are currently GHCR `latest` plus commit-SHA tags without SemVer tags, signing, SBOM/provenance, scanning, or formal Docker update policy.
- Corrected the Bandit remediation audit log: `pyproject.toml` currently has no `[tool.bandit]` baseline, so previous wording that claimed one was added was documentation drift.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.3.1` to `1.0.3.2` for the RID security hardening governance-alignment pass without changing public `VERSION`.
- Hardened local RID handling as boundary-adjacent integrity logic: new RID generation now emits `local:v2:<sig32>:<payload>` using a stronger signature construction.
- Preserved backward compatibility for valid standing legacy RIDs (`local:<sig10>:<payload>`) via old-read/new-write behavior.
- Tightened commit path authority so when `src_id` / `dst_parent_id` are present, RID resolution is authoritative and invalid RID values fail closed instead of silently downgrading to raw-path fallback.
- Added strict RID parsing and payload validation (grammar, prefix/version, signature shape, URL-safe Base64 decode, UTF-8 decode, root match, traversal/escape, ambiguous root handling) with explicit fail-closed outcomes.
- Resolved Bandit `B324` in `core/reader/ids.py` via real hardening (no suppression, no `usedforsecurity=False` workaround).
- Reconciled `pyproject.toml` and `scripts/_win_version_info.txt` to the canonical public `VERSION` value `1.0.3` from `core/version.py`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.3.0` to `1.0.3.1` for this governance/build-enforcement repository change.
- Updated the release and agent governance docs to reference the new hard validation scripts and workflow instead of prose-only policy.
- Completed a docs-only governance and stability realignment across SOT, system maps, contract docs, release docs, and README so BUS Core is described consistently as the sovereign local trust anchor rather than an expansion-stage product.
- Corrected the stale `SOT.md` header from `v1.0.2` to `v1.0.3` to match the canonical release authority in `core/version.py`.
- Final fortheemperor cleanup: aligned `dev.writes_enabled` config-model default with fresh-install write-enabled truth, removed active Settings ownership of `close_to_tray`, stubbed Theme control to honest system-only mode, and strengthened sidebar BUS Core brand composition.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.2.9` to `1.0.2.10` without changing public `VERSION`.
- Completed fortheemperor UI authority cleanup and route/module standardization passes across settings, contacts/vendors, manufacturing, inventory, and recipes using narrow reviewable changes.
- Completed contract-to-form parity remediation scopes for inventory, contacts, manufacturing, and recipes.
- Updated Recipes count-unit presentation policy so internal base unit `mc` is UI-hidden and operator-facing selectors present `ea`, while preserving backend/storage authority.
- Recorded write-gate operator-control finding: persisted `dev.writes_enabled` authority exists, while active UI has no direct writes toggle exposure.
- Removed dead UI card modules: `core/ui/js/cards/dev.js`, `core/ui/js/cards/fixkit.js`, `core/ui/js/cards/organizer.js`, `core/ui/js/cards/tasks.js`, `core/ui/js/cards/writes.js`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.2.8` to `1.0.2.9` without changing public `VERSION`.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.2.7` to `1.0.2.8` without changing public `VERSION`.
- Normalized `/app/system/state` and `/app/system/start-fresh` internal failures to return stable structured error envelopes instead of raw string details.
- Made the Home transaction dashboard disclose placeholder-only data whenever `/app/transactions*` still returns stub responses, instead of rendering stub-backed widgets as if they were live business data.
- Aligned manufacturing journaling with the canonical journal authority so runtime writes, restore/archive behavior, and isolated smoke all use `BUS_MANUFACTURING_JOURNAL` or the shared runtime `JOURNAL_DIR` instead of a separate LOCALAPPDATA-only path.
- Refreshed `scripts/_win_version_info.txt` to canonical `1.0.2` metadata so the tracked Windows version-info template matches the current build output.
- Corrected the release validation helpers so `smoke_isolated.ps1` quotes the dev-helper launch path under spaced Windows repo roots, auto-selects a free local port when `8765` is already occupied, `scripts/smoke.ps1` honors the wrapper's `%LOCALAPPDATA%` isolation path and `BUS_DB`-derived journal location, and `scripts/release-check.ps1` now hard-fails when smoke or build exits non-zero.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.2.6` to `1.0.2.7` without changing public `VERSION`.
- Reconciled `API_CONTRACT.md` against the live runtime so canonical business routes, supported operational protected routes, and secondary or legacy or drifted routes are documented as separate tiers.
- Corrected the declared contract for update check, system state, finance, item archive-delete behavior, canonical ledger history, and manufacturing run responses to match the current mounted surface and tests.
- Documented the current auth truth plainly where supported routes depend on middleware protection or lack a route-local write gate, rather than implying a cleaner authority model than the runtime actually uses.
- Bumped `INTERNAL_VERSION` from `1.0.2.5` to `1.0.2.6` without changing public `VERSION`.
- Reconciled auth validator authority so `core.api.http` owns protected-route validation, `AppState.tokens` is the canonical runtime token source, and `tgc.security.require_token_ctx` now delegates as a compatibility wrapper.
- Demoted `SESSION_TOKEN` and `session_token.txt` to secondary bootstrap/runtime mirrors instead of the normal request-validation authority.
- Reconciled config authority so `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json` is the single app-runtime settings authority, while `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\app\config.json` is read only as a one-way legacy fallback for recognized older keys.
- Moved durable `writes_enabled`, `role`, and `plan_only` persistence under the canonical root config file without changing public `/app/config` or `/policy` route shapes.
- Aligned `SOT.md`, the config/security authority maps, and the Settings UI copy with the exact canonical Windows path strings the config-authority drift guards enforce.
- Reconciled release authority so `.github/workflows/release-mirror.yml` reads `core/version.py`, fails unless the release tag equals `v{VERSION}`, and publishes manifest `latest.version` from canonical `VERSION`.
- Repaired `scripts/release-check.ps1` to validate the real current release chain: `smoke_isolated.ps1`, `build_core.ps1`, and the expected `dist/BUS-Core.exe` plus `dist/BUS-Core-<VERSION>.exe` artifacts.
- Aligned release/update documentation and README wording with actual behavior: Lighthouse remains the default manifest URL, checksum metadata may be published, and the app does not verify checksum, signature, publisher, or artifact size before surfacing `download_url`.

### Tests
- Added focused coverage for safe import preview/commit response shaping and sanitized transform proposal/policy output.
- Added focused Organizer path-safety coverage for valid in-root planning, traversal/start-path rejection, drive/UNC/device/null-byte rejection, malicious normalized-name rejection, and source guard checks.
- Added focused coverage for protected response sanitization and dev diagnostic route gating.
- Extended path-safety regression coverage for drive-relative, UNC/device, double-slash, tilde, and valid absolute in-root path handling.
- Added focused regression coverage for sandbox command construction, legacy router dispatch, admin preview rendering, and path traversal/outside-root rejection.
- Passed `node --check core/ui/js/cards/manufacturing.js`.
- Passed `node --check core/ui/js/cards/inventory.js`.
- Passed `node --check core/ui/js/lib/item-display.js`.
- Passed `git diff --check -- core/ui/js/lib/item-display.js core/ui/js/cards/inventory.js core/ui/js/cards/manufacturing.js`.
- Smoke was reported green for this focused UI correctness patch.
- UI contract audit was not completed: `scripts/ui_contract_audit.ps1` currently fails to parse at line 103, and `scripts/ui_contract_audit.sh` currently fails under bash because CRLF leaves `set: pipefail\r: invalid option name`.
- Added focused update-policy and manifest-validation coverage for allowed/rejected channels, stable backward compatibility, non-stable channel isolation, invalid metadata rejection, declared metadata retention, and the localhost/private-host error-code contract.
- Added targeted RID security coverage in `tests/test_reader_rid_security.py` for legacy compatibility, v2 resolution, malformed/tampered rejection, and mixed legacy/v2 commit-reader flows.
- Added Phase D validation coverage asserting the Home dashboard keeps explicit placeholder disclosure while it still depends on `/app/transactions*` stub routes.
- Extended config drift coverage to assert canonical path ownership, one-way legacy fallback behavior, and config startup wiring.
- Added auth-authority coverage for wrapper delegation, runtime-token precedence, configured session cookie extraction, shared route protection behavior, and code/docs drift alignment.
- Extended version drift coverage to assert release workflow tag/version checks, canonical asset naming, and truthful `release-check.ps1` wiring.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-04

BUS Core v1.0.0 establishes the platform as a **local-first manufacturing ledger kernel** with deterministic database behavior, onboarding workflow, and controlled update signaling.

This release marks the first stable version of BUS Core.

### Added

- Deterministic first-run onboarding wizard.
- Mandatory EULA acceptance gate during onboarding.
- Demo environment using a pre-seeded demo database.
- "Start Fresh Shop" action to transition from demo environment to production database.
- System runtime mode support (`demo` vs `production`).
- Settings-based update check (manual; current startup-check default is documented under `[Unreleased]`).
- Semantic versioning for BUS Core releases.
- Public API contract documentation.

### Changed

- Canonical UI routing stabilized in `core/ui/app.js`.
- First-run logic now relies on backend `/app/system/state`.
- Initial database state detection standardized.

### Fixed

- Hash routing suppression bug causing the first click to be ignored.
- Wizard redirect logic when default route already present.

### Notes

BUS Core remains:

- Local-first
- Offline-capable
- Zero telemetry
- Deterministic database behavior

Future releases will prioritize stability, bug fixes, and incremental polish rather than feature expansion.

### Added
- Initial update check system with `/app/update/check` for manifest-based version checks and normalized six-field response surface.

### Security
- Hardened update manifest fetch path with deterministic SSRF guards, redirect rejection (`follow_redirects=False`), JSON-only validation, and streaming 64KB size cap enforcement.

### UX
- Settings now supports manual "Check now" with conditional Download action, plus optional startup update notice when both update config gates allow it.
- launcher: open /ui/shell.html without a hash to preserve deterministic first-run onboarding routing.

### Tests
- Added/updated update-check coverage for streaming size cap enforcement, strict SemVer handling, manifest URL validation and SSRF cases, redirect/content-type behavior, and response contract key stability.
- Finance page (`#/finance`) with KPI summary and transaction history.

### API
- Added finance read endpoints: `/app/finance/summary` and `/app/finance/transactions`.

### Correctness
- Enforced sales aggregation barriers by `source_id` and stock-authority COGS derivation from sold stock movements.
- Added double-count guard regression test for repeated summary reads.

### Tests
- Added `tests/api/test_finance_double_count_guard.py` and expanded finance suite coverage across summary, transactions, stock-authority, and validation scenarios.

- First-run onboarding wizard (`#/welcome`) with deterministic backend boot probe.

### API
- Added `/app/system/state` for first-run detection and readiness reporting.

### UX
- Auto-launch onboarding only on clean DB; Settings button to re-run onboarding.

### Tests
- Added/updated `system_state` tests covering empty/non-empty/status and canonical failure envelope.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-03-04 — Finance Stabilization & Archive Model

### Added
- `items.is_archived` column (additive, non-breaking).
- Archive semantics for Items.
- Smoke isolation wrapper (`scripts/smoke_isolated.ps1`).

### Changed
- `DELETE /app/items/{id}` now archives items with history instead of returning `409`.
- `GET /app/items` excludes archived items by default.
- Optional `?include_archived=true` query parameter added for full item listings.

### Fixed
- Prevented orphaned finance history via hard delete path by archiving when history exists.
- Ensured smoke tests cannot mutate working database by forcing temporary `BUS_DB` in smoke wrapper.

### Security / Integrity
- Ledger invariants preserved.
- Finance remains fail-closed for missing Item resolution.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-02-25 — System Normalisation

### Added
- **Canonical Unit Model**: All inventory quantities are now stored as integer base units (milli-count `mc` for count dimension; `1 ea = 1000 mc`). The canonical helper `normalize_quantity_to_base_int()` is the single authority for all unit conversions. Hardcoded multipliers outside this helper are non-compliant.
- **Cost Authority Rule**: `unit_cost_cents` is always cost-per-human-unit (`item.uom`). Multiplying `unit_cost_cents` by base quantities directly is forbidden. General and manufacturing cost formulas now convert base→human before applying costs.
- **Recipes v2 Contract**: Recipe payloads accept and respond with v2 fields; legacy `qty_base` keys are rejected.
- **Ledger History v2 Response**: `/app/ledger/history` returns human-readable fields (`quantity_decimal`, `uom`) by default; raw base fields hidden unless `?include_base=true`.
- **Finance Refund v2 Contract**: Refund endpoint enforces v2 payload; legacy `qty_base` on refund is rejected.
- **API Governance Document**: Added `API_CONTRACT.md` as the authoritative API contract reference.
- **UI Deep-link Routing (Phase B)**:
  - `index.html` de-brained to a redirect stub; single SPA authority is `shell.html` / `app.js`.
  - Legacy `router.js` disabled by default.
  - `app.js`: `normalizeHash`, alias redirects (`#/dashboard→#/home`, `#/items→#/inventory`, `#/vendors→#/contacts`), `BUS_ROUTE` param capture, dedicated 404 page.
  - Deep-links for `#/inventory/<id>`, `#/contacts/<id>`, `#/recipes/<id>` (happy path + not-found redirect).
- **Inventory UX Polish**: Dimension-safe UOM dropdown filtering; remaining qty display without legacy int reconstruction; metadata-only save; warn-on-blank-quantity.
- **Audit Tooling**: `scripts/ui_contract_audit.sh` and `scripts/ui_phaseA_structural_guard.sh` hardened (path normalisation, controlled exclusions, zero false positives).
- **Test Coverage**: Phase 2A/2B/2D regression suites; smoke harness deterministic with canonical stock-in/out seeding; FIFO ordering assertions; count items with explicit `uom=ea`.
- **Launcher**: Tray icon now uses `core/ui/Logo.png` via pystray for correct Windows tray display.

### Changed
- Manufacturing service: output quantities and all intermediate values use base-integer arithmetic. `float()` removed from cost path; `Decimal` used throughout for round-half-up cost authority.
- Manufacturing costing: per-output unit cost computed as `round_half_up_cents(total_input_cost_cents / human_output_qty)`. Division by base output quantity forbidden.
- Smoke harness: replaced `/app/adjust` seeding with canonical `/app/stock/in` and `/app/stock/out` v2 contracts; deterministic end-to-end runs green.
- SOT.md: sealed with Phase 0–1 authority locks and Phase 2A–2D verification evidence.

### Breaking Changes
- **`qty_base` keys removed from Recipes, Ledger, and Finance (Refund) responses**. Consumers must migrate to `quantity_decimal` + `uom` fields. See Migration Notes below.
- **Base unit for count is `mc` (milli-count), NOT `ea`**. Any code that assumed `ea` as storage base with multiplier=1 is non-compliant. Use `normalize_quantity_to_base_int()`.
- **Manufacturing endpoint rejects legacy `quantity` key**. Use `quantity_decimal` + `uom` in all manufacture run payloads.

### Migration Notes
1. **Recipes payload**: Replace `qty_base: <int>` with `quantity_decimal: "<decimal>"` + `uom: "<uom>"` in recipe component definitions.
2. **Ledger history clients**: Default response no longer includes `qty_change` (base int). Use `quantity_decimal` + `uom`. Pass `?include_base=true` if base fields are required for internal audit.
3. **Finance refund**: Remove `qty_base` from refund payloads. Use `quantity_decimal` + `uom`.
4. **Count inventory**: Any client computing `qty * price` directly must call the backend cost API. Count items use `mc` base; 1 unit = 1000 mc in storage.
5. **Manufacturing runs**: Replace `quantity` payload key with `quantity_decimal` (string decimal) + `uom`.

## [0.10.1] — 2026-02-10
### Added
- Registered pytest markers in `pytest.ini` for `unit`, `api`, `integration`, `smoke`, and `slow`.
- Added `tests/TEST_PLAN.md` and `tests/RUNNING_TESTS.md` to document coverage and test execution.
- Added a high-signal finance invariant test for refund cash-only behavior.

### Changed
- Hardened plugin import-guard tests to use tmp-path plugin roots and avoid repository pollution.
- Reduced duplicated smoke assertions in manufacturing flow tests while preserving core invariants.
- Strengthened inventory journal purchase assertions by validating `qty_stored` updates.
- Marked index/path tests as `unit` and removed brittle path bootstrap setup.

## [0.8.8] — 2025-12-08
### Changed
- Windows restore: reliable on SQLite/Windows via lazy SQLAlchemy engine (NullPool), indexer worker-only, explicit stop around restore, WAL checkpoint + handle disposal, bounded exclusive check, atomic replace (MoveFileEx), and journal archive/recreate. Returns `{ "restart_required": true }` on success.
- Smoke harness: commit uses authenticated WebSession (no background job cookie loss); fast fail for restore lock contention; deterministic end-to-end run now green.
- Logging: clear `[restore] …` breadcrumbs; consistent request log lines.

### Fixed
- Restore 401 during `/app/db/import/commit` when executed from background jobs (cookies lost). Smoke now maintains session and validates error envelope shapes.

### Removed
- Redundant/stale dev scripts and assets (see repo pruning below).

## [0.8.7] — 2025-12-08
### Changed
- Error UX: all non-2xx responses are visible; `400` keeps dialogs open (field errors), `5xx/timeout` shows persistent banner; unified error parsing for string/object/list variants.

## [0.8.6] — deferred
- Routing/deep-links polish moved to last pre-0.9 batch (UI).

## v0.8.3
- Journals append only after database commits; restore archives and recreates journals.
- Password-based AES-GCM exports to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/BUSCore/exports` with preview/commit restore flow.
- Admin UI card for export/restore plus smoke coverage for reversible restores.

## v0.8.2
- Single-run POST contract for manufacturing runs.
- Fail-fast manufacturing (shortages=400, no writes).
- Atomic commit on success.
- Output costing rule (round-half-up).
- Manufacturing never oversells.
- Adjustments aligned to FIFO semantics.

## v0.8.1
- Core is tierless; removed all licensing logic and Pro gating.
- `/health` is tier-blind: returns only `{ ok, version }`.
- Deleted `/dev/license` and license.json handling.
- Removed Pro-only features (RFQ, batch automation, scheduled runs).
- **UI:** Removed license/tier badge and all “Pro/Upgrade” wording.
