# Changelog

## v0.8.1
- Core is tierless; removed all licensing logic and Pro gating.
- `/health` is tier-blind: returns only `{ ok, version }`.
- Deleted `/dev/license` and license.json handling.
- Removed Pro-only features (RFQ, batch automation, scheduled runs).
- **UI:** Removed license/tier badge and all “Pro/Upgrade” wording.
