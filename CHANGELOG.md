# Changelog

## [0.8.8] — 2025-12-08
### Changed
- Windows restore: reliable on SQLite/Windows via lazy SQLAlchemy engine (NullPool), indexer worker-only, explicit stop around restore, WAL checkpoint + handle disposal, bounded exclusive check, atomic replace (MoveFileEx), and journal archive/recreate. Returns `{ "restart_required": true }` on success.
- Smoke harness: commit uses authenticated WebSession (no background job cookie loss); fast fail for restore lock contention; deterministic end-to-end run now green.
- Logging: clear `[restore] …` breadcrumbs; consistent request log lines.

### Fixed
- Restore 401 during `/app/db/import/commit` when executed from background jobs (cookies lost). Smoke now maintains session and validates error envelope shapes.

### Removed
- Redundant/stale dev scripts and assets (see repo pruning below).

## [0.8.7] — 2025-12-08
### Changed
- Error UX: all non-2xx responses are visible; `400` keeps dialogs open (field errors), `5xx/timeout` shows persistent banner; unified error parsing for string/object/list variants.

## [0.8.6] — deferred
- Routing/deep-links polish moved to last pre-0.9 batch (UI).

## v0.8.3
- Journals append only after database commits; restore archives and recreates journals.
- Password-based AES-GCM exports to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/BUSCore/exports` with preview/commit restore flow.
- Admin UI card for export/restore plus smoke coverage for reversible restores.

## v0.8.2
- Single-run POST contract for manufacturing runs.
- Fail-fast manufacturing (shortages=400, no writes).
- Atomic commit on success.
- Output costing rule (round-half-up).
- Manufacturing never oversells.
- Adjustments aligned to FIFO semantics.

## v0.8.1
- Core is tierless; removed all licensing logic and Pro gating.
- `/health` is tier-blind: returns only `{ ok, version }`.
- Deleted `/dev/license` and license.json handling.
- Removed Pro-only features (RFQ, batch automation, scheduled runs).
- **UI:** Removed license/tier badge and all “Pro/Upgrade” wording.
