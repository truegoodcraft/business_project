BUS-Core

The local-first ERP for Makers. Inventory, Manufacturing, and Contacts. No cloud required.

BUS-Core is a free, open-source business utility system built for small workshops and independent makers. It runs entirely on your local machine, giving you full control of your data. No subscriptions, no forced updates, no cloud lock-in.

At its core, BUS-Core helps you track everything that moves through your shop:

Materials & Consumables: Record stock by unit (grams, millimeters, milliliters, or each), with batch numbers, purchase price, and date added.

Blueprints(Recipe): Define the recipes that turn raw materials into assemblies or finished goods. BUS-Core automatically calculates cost of goods based on the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) batches you’ve actually purchased.

Assemblies & Products: Produce items using your blueprints and set a final selling price—then compare the real cost of input materials against sales to measure margin and waste.

Vendors: Link materials and consumables to vendors and track their pricing history over time.

It’s not an accounting program, and it’s not trying to be.
BUS-Core exists to replace spreadsheet chaos and overpriced SaaS platforms that bleed your margins. It’s your own local workshop system—clean, transparent, and yours.

## Key Features

- Zero-License: 100% free and open-source (AGPLv3). No “Pro” tiers, no locked features, no tracking.
- Precision Inventory: Integer-based metric tracking with FIFO batch valuation and accurate stock costing.
- Manufacturing Engine: Recipe-based builds with automatic cost rollups, shortage detection, and atomic commits.
- Ledger & Audit Trail: Full movement history—purchases, production, sales, loss, and adjustments.
- Local & Private: Runs on a local SQLite database with optional AES-GCM encrypted backups.
- Cross-Platform: Works on Windows (primary), Linux, and macOS.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* Windows (Primary support), Linux, or macOS

### Installation

1.  Download the .zip File and Extract it.
2.  Double click Run Core.bat
    

**Note for Windows Users:** The application runs in the **System Tray**. If the browser does not open automatically, or if you close the window, double-click the tray icon to access the dashboard.

*(If Windows blocks the script, run: `PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\scripts\launch.ps1"` in a Powershell window to sidestep it)*

## Dev Mode

For developers contributing to the core:

```bash
python launcher.py --dev
````

  * **Console Access:** Keeps the terminal window open (hidden by default in production).
  * **Debug Endpoints:** Enables access to protected `/dev` API routes.
  * **Smoke Tests:** Validate system integrity using `scripts/smoke.ps1`.

## Architecture

See [docs/SOT.md](docs/SOT.md) for the Source of Truth and architecture details.
