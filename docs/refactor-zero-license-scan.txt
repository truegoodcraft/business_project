README.md:124:  * `core/` – The Microkernel application (FastAPI, domain logic, policy).
README.md:126:  * `plugins/` – Directory for external capability providers.
README.md:139:  * **Pull requests are welcome.** Especially small, focused fixes and docs improvements.
README.md:140:  * **No entitlement.** I don’t owe anyone features or timelines. I’ll merge what fits the project and my own use first.
README.md:148:If I ever charge money, it will be for **Pro automation and “power user” features** — the kind of things you only need once BUS Core is already in the middle of your daily work. If you never reach that point, you should never feel pushed to pay.
README.md:150:I don’t even plan to run Pro for myself until I actually need it. When I do, I’ll pay for it like everyone else.
README.md:160:This is a side project, but it is not a throwaway project. My wife and kids see the hours going into this. That matters to me. If I’m spending family time on it, it has to be something I’m willing to run my own shop on for years — not just a pretty demo.

Style v1.0.0.txt:7:The prevailing design ethos of the contemporary web—characterized by ample whitespace, soft shadows, rounded corners, and pastel gradients—is fundamentally at odds with the stated mission of BUS Core. As a local-only, offline-first business backend built on Python and SQLite, BUS Core is not a "service" to be consumed; it is a "machine" to be operated.1 The architectural reality of this software—a sovereign, telemetry-free, solo-developer project—demands a visual language that reflects its structural integrity. It requires an interface that is rugged, transparent, and utilitarian.
Style v1.0.0.txt:9:The proposed design system, termed "The Sovereign Console," draws heavily from three distinct lineages to satisfy the user's request for a style that represents the "idea and feel" of the software:
Style v1.0.0.txt:13:This document serves as the roadmap for transforming the current HTML/JS shell into a cohesive, professional-grade interface that feels like a piece of high-precision heavy machinery. It is written for the developer-architect, treating the UI as a critical component of the system's engineering.
Style v1.0.0.txt:17:The visual identity of software is inextricably linked to its architecture. BUS Core runs locally, without telemetry or cloud dependencies.1 This architectural reality must drive the user interface (UI) design. Unlike cloud-based SaaS products that must mask latency with spinners and skeletons, a local-first application interacts with the speed of the hardware it runs on. The interface must not only facilitate this speed but visually celebrate it.
Style v1.0.0.txt:22:Research into local-first software suggests that the "availability of another computer should never prevent you from working".10 Visually, this means the interface should eschew "connection status" icons that imply dependency. Instead, the UI should project stability. The "Save" icon is not a cloud with an arrow; it is a hard drive or a chip, symbolizing local persistence. The feedback loops must be tighter than standard web apps. When a user updates a vendor record in BUS Core, the interface should not display a loading spinner while waiting for a 200 OK response; it should commit the change visually instantly, trusting the local SQLite transaction.8
Style v1.0.0.txt:23:This psychology extends to the "solo project" nature of the software.1 The interface should not try to look like a corporate product designed by a committee. It should feel opinionated, specific, and crafted. It is the "AI dreamed about as a kid" 1, which implies a sense of wonder attached to the machine—a "Cyber" aesthetic that looks like the interfaces in 1980s and 90s sci-fi, but updated with modern usability standards.
Style v1.0.0.txt:29:The SaaS Approach: The toggle greys out, a spinner appears, the server confirms, and the toggle snaps to the new state. This introduces cognitive friction.
Style v1.0.0.txt:30:The BUS Core Approach: The toggle snaps instantly with a satisfying visual "clunk" (animation), and the database updates in the background milliseconds later. If an error occurs (rare in local SQLite), a "Check Engine" style warning light activates.
Style v1.0.0.txt:31:This approach aligns with the "Real-World Observation" philosophy of BUS Core.1 The software mimics the physics of real-world machinery where cause and effect are simultaneous. The user, operating a local Python backend, expects the machine to obey instantly.
Style v1.0.0.txt:43:To achieve the "Industrial UI" feel requested 2, we must look beyond standard web design trends and analyze the interfaces of professional hardware: CNC machines, mass spectrometers, and military field tablets. The "Cyber-Industrial" look is not about decoration; it is about the "honest" presentation of function.
Style v1.0.0.txt:56:The user query mentions a "Cyber" feel. This intersects with the "Cyberpunk" aesthetic—neon grids, monospaced data streams, and high-tech dystopia.6 However, for a business backend, we must avoid the "video game" trap. The interface must remain legible and professional. We are building a tool for a "solo project" that handles "money in/out" 1, so clarity is paramount.
Style v1.0.0.txt:80:To legitimize the "Industrial" feel, the color signals must strictly adhere to real-world safety standards. This creates a subconscious association with professional equipment. When the user sees red, it shouldn't just mean "error"; it should mean "STOP" in the OSHA sense.
Style v1.0.0.txt:121:Why: Amber light has longer wavelengths that filter better through smoke or poor conditions and is less disrupting to night vision. Using an "Amber Mode" for the interface would be a powerful "pro-user" feature, allowing the user to switch to a low-blue-light mode for late-night coding sessions.
Style v1.0.0.txt:141:Share Tech Mono 39 has a specific "sci-fi" geometry that looks very industrial but may be less legible at small sizes than JetBrains Mono. It is excellent for "Big Number" displays (e.g., Total Daily Revenue) where the aesthetic character can shine without compromising readability.
Style v1.0.0.txt:145:For headers, labels, and buttons, a proportional sans-serif font is needed to save horizontal space while maintaining the "engineered" look. A monospace font for everything can feel cluttered and amateurish.
Style v1.0.0.txt:151:Space Grotesk 45 retains the quirkiness of a monospace font but in a proportional package, giving a very distinct "brutalist" character. It feels "raw" and "unprocessed," fitting the "no-telemetry" ethos.
Style v1.0.0.txt:169:Visual Metaphor: This mimics the machined edges of a metal faceplate or the protective rubber bumpers on a rugged Getac laptop.48 It implies that the interface has been "reinforced" against impact.
Style v1.0.0.txt:200:Tactile Animation: When clicked, the switch should depress instantly (scale down to 98%) and snap back, mimicking the spring tension of a mechanical switch. This provides the "visual haptics" discussed in Section 1.
Style v1.0.0.txt:210:In a local-first application, the "state" of the data is the most critical information. The user needs to know: "Is this data safe? Is it processed? Is the machine running?"
Style v1.0.0.txt:218:Rapid Amber Flash: Write operation in progress (Optimistic update occurring).
Style v1.0.0.txt:220:Source Inspiration: The status LEDs on server racks or the "CPU Usage" graphs in Windows Task Manager. It provides reassurance that the "machine is running" even when the user isn't interacting with it.8
Style v1.0.0.txt:232:Phosphor Glow: Text inputs can have a slight text-shadow bloom (e.g., text-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.7)) to mimic the electron bleed of a CRT. This improves contrast against dark backgrounds and makes the text feel "alive".54
Style v1.0.0.txt:243:Manufacturing Queue: A Kanban-style list, but styled as a production line schedule (horizontal progress bars).
Style v1.0.0.txt:252:Properties (Weight, Cost, Vendor) are listed in a strict grid with dotted leaders connecting Label to Value: Weight..................... 45kg
Style v1.0.0.txt:257:Manufacturing is a temporal process. It needs a layout that shows time and sequence.
Style v1.0.0.txt:258:Timeline Visualization: Use a horizontal "Gantt-lite" bar to show the progress of a run.
Style v1.0.0.txt:274:Alternative: NES.css or 98.css (Retro): If the user wants a more "Retro-Computing" vibe, 98.css provides valid Windows 98 button styles which are incredibly utilitarian and familiar to industrial operators.61 However, a custom "Dark Industrial" theme built on Tailwind is likely the most flexible route.
Style v1.0.0.txt:300:Screen Reader Support: Even though it's an "Industrial" UI, semantic HTML (<main>, <article>, <label>) is non-negotiable. Real industrial software is often used by diverse teams; accessibility is a professional requirement.
Style v1.0.0.txt:310:Backup Interface: A prominent, one-click "Dump Database" button that instantly generates a .sqlite or .zip file download. This reinforces the "Local-Only" nature—you own the file, you save the file.1
Style v1.0.0.txt:320:The proposed design for BUS Core is a departure from the ephemeral, cloud-centric design trends of the 2020s. It embraces Industrial Cyber-Brutalism—a style that prioritizes durability, density, and local sovereignty.
Style v1.0.0.txt:321:By adopting Safety Orange as a signal color, JetBrains Mono for data integrity, and Augmented UI patterns for structural rigidity, BUS Core will not just function like a business backend; it will feel like a piece of precision tooling. It transforms the user from a "subscriber" into an "operator," aligning perfectly with the solo-developer, offline-first philosophy of the project.
Style v1.0.0.txt:322:This specification provides the blueprint. The next step is to fire up the forge (IDE) and start hammering the raw HTML into the chassis of the Digital Machine.
Style v1.0.0.txt:336:Immediate transitions: Animations should be short (<100ms) or non-existent. A "fade in" implies a loading process; a "snap" implies a mechanical connection.
Style v1.0.0.txt:337:The "Mechanical" Click: When a button is pressed, use CSS transform: active: scale(0.98) to simulate the physical resistance of a button. This provides "visual haptics".5
Style v1.0.0.txt:341:The user stated: "No accounts, no telemetry, no cloud".1 The UI must prove this to the user.
Style v1.0.0.txt:352:Industrial interfaces (HMI) for CNC machines and PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) prioritize specific traits 2:
Style v1.0.0.txt:363:Exposed IDs: Don't hide the database IDs. Display ID: 4092 prominently. It helps the "solo operator" debug and cross-reference.
Style v1.0.0.txt:369:Color psychology in industrial settings is purely functional. We are not trying to sell a product; we are trying to prevent errors.
Style v1.0.0.txt:373:The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines colors for safety signs. BUS Core should appropriate these for UI feedback.18
Style v1.0.0.txt:388:"Prohibition/Danger" - Delete, Stop Run
Style v1.0.0.txt:411:DIN 1451 is the font of German industry. It is associated with precision engineering. Since the user cannot license official DIN for a free project, we look to open-source alternatives.23
Style v1.0.0.txt:417:Code is the DNA of this project. Using a coding font for the data brings the "developer" identity to the surface.37
Style v1.0.0.txt:456:6.2 Manufacturing Process Visualization
Style v1.0.0.txt:508:The visual identity of BUS Core is defined by its refusal to compromise on function. It rejects the soft, cloud-centric aesthetics of the modern web in favor of a "Sovereign Industrial" language. By employing high-contrast safety colors, monospaced data structures, and the raw, panel-based layouts of heavy machinery, the software communicates its core values: Reliability, Privacy, and Power.

docs/SOT.md:10:> **Change note (2025-12-02, v0.5.2):** Documented all HTTP endpoints that were missing from the SoT but present in the BUS Core v0.5.1 “Iron Core” system map: `/favicon.ico`, `/session/token/plain`, `/session/rotate`, `/transparency.report`, `/logs`, Reader endpoints (`/reader/resolve_ids`, `/reader/resolve_paths`), Reader settings (`/settings/reader` GET/POST), plugin registry/capability endpoints (`/plugins`, `/plugins/{service_id}/read`, `/plugins/{pid}/enable`, `/probe`, `/capabilities`, `/execTransform`, `/nodes.manifest.sync`), and data-export/import endpoints under `/app/export` and `/app/import/*`.
docs/SOT.md:11:> **Change note (2025-11-30, v0.5.1 "Iron Core"):** Captures first pass of canonical **Inventory** and **Contacts** UI behavior (Shallow/Deep inputs, expanded-only mutating actions, structured contact meta), clarifies **session token** response shapes and the requirement that all `/app/**` calls send an authoritative `X-Session-Token` header, and defines launcher dependency rules (pinned `pip`, `requirements.lock` priority, offline/cached install planned) plus the **Python 3.12** Windows runtime target.
docs/SOT.md:12:> **Change note (2025-11-26, v0.5.0 "Iron Core"):** Roll-up version bump to v0.3.0 “Iron Core” reflecting integrated Home/dashboard layout and sidebar structure, single-operator design ethos, local-only analytics event store and “analytics from local events only” principle, optional anonymous license hash and push-only telemetry model, and clarified manufacturing run cost/capacity view and Core vs Pro philosophical split from the 2025-11-24 session.
docs/SOT.md:16:> clarifies manufacturing run cost/capacity view and Core vs Pro philosophical split.
docs/SOT.md:19:> **Change note (2025-11-20):** Promotes `scripts/dev_bootstrap.ps1` to canonical dev launcher; preserves manual dev/smoke flow for clarity;
docs/SOT.md:20:> documents Pro gating surfaces and current gaps (DB still under repo; AppData not yet cut over).
docs/SOT.md:32:  * All BUS Core SoTs and adjacent TGC method/process docs use a three-part version string: `vX.Y.Z`.
docs/SOT.md:34:  * **X – Release track.** `0` = pre–official-release track; `1` = first formal release of the method/product;
docs/SOT.md:38:    * **Y – Document / product major version.** Bump when the structure or meaning of the document changes in a way that could confuse someone reading an older version (sections moved, concepts redefined, new rules added, etc.).
docs/SOT.md:75:  * **Product name (canonical):** **TGC BUS Core**
docs/SOT.md:97:  * **Explicit Pro surfaces:** anything Pro-only must be clearly documented.
docs/SOT.md:129:  * Contacts behave as vendor rows with appropriate `role` / `kind`.
docs/SOT.md:161:    * Each manufacturing run takes a **recipe** and a **quantity** and must produce a **run result view** that shows, in one place:
docs/SOT.md:186:  * Optionally surface the **margin-like delta**: `(value_of_stock_added – total_material_cost)` as an approximate indicator (not accounting-grade).
docs/SOT.md:193:    * For each limiting input material, compute how many **additional units** can be produced with current stock:
docs/SOT.md:202:* Surface this as “You can still produce **N** more units with current [material] stock.”
docs/SOT.md:203:* These calculations are **Core behavior** (community tier) and must be computed locally from the items table and recipe definitions;
docs/SOT.md:204:they do **not** require Pro, remote services, or any LLM features.
docs/SOT.md:236:`mountInventory()` | Pro intent: `POST /app/manufacturing/run` |
docs/SOT.md:250:  * **Badge:** `[data-role="license-badge"]` shows `License: <tier>` from the protected health payload.
docs/SOT.md:251:* **Gating policy:** backend enforces; UI keeps Pro controls visible but disabled or clearly labeled where appropriate (RFQ Generate, **Execute Manufacturing Run**, Import Commit).
docs/SOT.md:255:      * Tooltip (community): “Run a single recipe now (free) – save & automate in Pro”
docs/SOT.md:258:UI not yet tier-aware.
docs/SOT.md:270:* The existing Business Profile editor (backed by `/app/business_profile`) remains unchanged;
docs/SOT.md:272:### 5.4.2 Settings screen — Startup & launcher behavior (planned)
docs/SOT.md:284:          * When enabled, closing the launcher window via the standard “X” control hides it to the tray instead of terminating the process.
docs/SOT.md:285:* When disabled, closing the launcher window stops the BUS Core server and exits the launcher process.
docs/SOT.md:291:  * Update §5.2–§5.4 **before** changing routes/primary screens/Pro surfaces.
docs/SOT.md:293:  * New Pro surface ⇒ add a **community negative test** in smoke.
docs/SOT.md:417:  * A row of **large clickable cards** in the main content area provides primary navigation into core flows.
docs/SOT.md:461:until a dedicated `#/runs` route exists, this entry may deep-link into the appropriate section.
docs/SOT.md:503:      * **Default value:** `Product`.
docs/SOT.md:504:* Allowed options (UI-level): `Product | Material | Component`.
docs/SOT.md:511:* `qty` and `item_type` must satisfy DB constraints (§8.1.2) but may be provided via defaults when the user leaves them blank.
docs/SOT.md:555:* Below approximately **700px** viewport width:
docs/SOT.md:572:  * There are **no plain-letter global shortcuts** on the Contacts screen unless explicitly approved in this SoT.
docs/SOT.md:600:  * Provides the **mutating actions**:
docs/SOT.md:700:  * **Default tier:** `community`.
docs/SOT.md:703:* **Gating policy (v1):** gate **only**:
docs/SOT.md:706:    2.  `POST /app/manufacturing/run` — **gates Pro automation surface only**, not the free single-run button (community can still run one-off manufacturing runs manually).
docs/SOT.md:712:* No “surprise” gates: any new Pro surface must be added to this section before release.
docs/SOT.md:743:### 7.2 Core vs Pro philosophical boundaries
docs/SOT.md:745:This section captures the **philosophical split** between Core (free) and Pro (paid), aligning with the current technical gating.
docs/SOT.md:748:      * Items (materials and products).
docs/SOT.md:759:      * Attach receipts, invoices, SOPs, product docs to items/vendors/runs via attachments.
docs/SOT.md:766:  * **Pro (Paid, automation):**
docs/SOT.md:783:* Third-party plugins may replicate some Pro-like behaviors for advanced users; Pro remains the **official**, maintained, and supported automation/integration path.
docs/SOT.md:787:> Pro = robots & integrations.\*\*
docs/SOT.md:846:* `item_type` — `String`, not null, server default `"product"`.
docs/SOT.md:847:    Soft classification field (e.g. product/material/etc.); values not yet enforced by constraint.
docs/SOT.md:891:    Identifier for the process/reader that created this attachment.
docs/SOT.md:907:## 8.2 Plans database schema (canonical as of 2025-11-22)
docs/SOT.md:909:BUS Core uses a separate SQLite **plans database** at:
docs/SOT.md:911:  * Windows: `<APP_DIR>/plans.db`
docs/SOT.md:913:This DB holds long-lived “plans” for the planner system.
docs/SOT.md:914:### 8.2.1 Table: `plans`
docs/SOT.md:919:    Stable plan identifier.
docs/SOT.md:921:    ISO-8601 timestamp string of when the plan was created.
docs/SOT.md:923:    Where the plan came from (e.g. which tool or workflow).
docs/SOT.md:925:    Human-readable plan title.
docs/SOT.md:929:    String enum stored as text (Planner status value).
docs/SOT.md:931:JSON-encoded statistics for the plan.
docs/SOT.md:933:    JSON-encoded list of actions in the plan.
docs/SOT.md:934:There are no additional tables in `plans.db` as of 2025-11-22.
docs/SOT.md:961:* **Duplicate-name policy (POST):** if an existing row with the **same `name`** exists:
docs/SOT.md:989:  * **Success policy (smoke):** treat **`200 OK`** as CRUD success;
docs/SOT.md:996:      * Protected: status 200;

docs/SOT.md:1121:## 11\) Operations & Release Process (authoritative)
docs/SOT.md:1146:  * **Production/state paths (Windows):**
docs/SOT.md:1168:          * Starting the BUS Core server process.
docs/SOT.md:1192:  * **Restart BUS Core server** — call `POST /server/restart` and then restart the managed server process.
docs/SOT.md:1198:  * **Exit BUS Core** — stop the server process and quit the launcher.
docs/SOT.md:1203:        * The launcher process stays alive in the tray while BUS Core is running.
docs/SOT.md:1206:  * “Exit BUS Core” must shut down the server cleanly and then exit the launcher process.
docs/SOT.md:1208:  * “Restart BUS Core server” routes through the `/server/restart` endpoint rather than killing the process directly.
docs/SOT.md:1303:    * Based on standard Python template, plus project-specific entries:
docs/SOT.md:1349:    surface tier/flags to UI to lock controls.
docs/SOT.md:1367:  * **Offline mode:** implement the planned offline/cached install mode (wheelhouse/cached wheels + appropriate `pip` flags).
docs/SOT.md:1395:    * Decide on phone-number **formatting/normalization** policy (raw vs normalized formats like E.164) for display and storage.
docs/SOT.md:1403:    * Investigate the observed `h11 LocalProtocolError: Too much data for declared Content-Length` during manual runs and determine which endpoint(s) need attention.
docs/SOT.md:1406:  * Clarify whether any 404s on `/app/transactions/summary`, `/dev/license`, `/dev/writes`, `/app/business_profile` are **expected stubs** or indicate missing endpoints that must be implemented and documented.
docs/SOT.md:1421:  * Exact tool/process for generating `requirements.lock` (e.g. `pip-tools` / `pip-compile` vs `pip freeze`) and whether to record hashes/markers.
docs/SOT.md:1445:\* Callers *may* send the token via `X-Session-Token` on subsequent protected calls, but cookie is preferred.
docs/SOT.md:1467:  * With valid token/session → detailed payload (200) with **tests for presence of keys** `version`, `policy`, `license`, `run-id`.
docs/SOT.md:1480:      * **GET `/dev/journal/info`** — tails `data/journals/**manufacturing.jsonl` *(or legacy `inventory.jsonl` until rename is completed)* (protected).
docs/SOT.md:1504:    * **POST `/app/export`** — export the current application database to an encrypted container (password-protected);
docs/SOT.md:1510:  * **POST `/app/import/commit`** — apply a validated import; gated by license and policy (owner + writes), logs into the bulk import journal.
docs/SOT.md:1512:  * **Manufacturing:** `POST /app/manufacturing/run` (manual manufacturing run; Pro features gate automation/scheduling).
docs/SOT.md:1518:  * **Plugin broker:** HTTP-level endpoints mediated via `get_broker` and policy checks.
docs/SOT.md:1530:  * **POST `/probe`** — probe plugin / service availability (health-style check).
docs/SOT.md:1534:  * **POST `/execTransform`** — execute a plugin-provided transformation against input payloads.
docs/SOT.md:1538:  * **Drive provider:** Google Drive adapter exposed via REST:
docs/SOT.md:1564:### Policy, Plans, and Health
docs/SOT.md:1566:  * **GET/POST `/policy`** — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json`.
docs/SOT.md:1567:  * **POST `/plans`**, **GET `/plans`**, **GET `/plans/{id}`**, **GET `/plans/{id}/export`** — plan lifecycle;
docs/SOT.md:1575:  * **POST `/server/restart`** — schedules process exit so launcher can restart.
docs/SOT.md:1583:      * **License utilities** (`_license_path`, `get_license`, `fetch_and_cache_license`) resolve `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\license.json` (or `BUS_ROOT`) and normalize tier/flags.
docs/SOT.md:1599:      * **Policy helpers** (`load_policy`, `save_policy`, `require_owner_commit`).
docs/SOT.md:1601:  * **Plan storage** (`save_plan`, `get_plan`, `list_plans`, `preview_plan`, `commit_local`).
docs/SOT.md:1617:      * `X-Session-Token` on protected requests (all `/app/**`);
docs/SOT.md:1639:      * **Reader settings:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\settings_reader.json`; **policy config:** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\config.json`.
docs/SOT.md:1645:  * **CRUD success:** `200 OK` only (smoke policy). 404s on known legacy endpoints are acceptable.
docs/SOT.md:1668:  * The ×100 metric measurement plan remains a design-only future option.
docs/SOT.md:1746:  Needs: A deprecation/removal plan (version target, migration notes, and whether any third-party tooling depends on it).
docs/SOT.md:1749:  Needs: A product/engineering decision on whether to adopt it, and if so, a migration strategy for existing data.
docs/SOT.md:1752:  Needs: A concrete schema proposal (table name, primary key, indices) aligned with Home dashboard and Insights requirements.

docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:8:* **Policy mode**: Loaded from `config/policy.json`. Default is `enforce` with deny-by-default rules.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:13:* **HTTP API** (localhost only): `/health`, `/plugins`, `/probe`, `/capabilities`, `/execTransform`, `/policy.simulate`, `/nodes.manifest.sync`, `/transparency.report`, `/logs`.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:15:* **Sandbox**: Transform executions run in an ephemeral subprocess with a per-run temporary directory and a hard timeout.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:19:* **Journal path**: `data/journal.log` (append-only JSONL). Each entry records `journal_id`, `intent`, hashes of inputs/proposals, policy version, and `prev_hash` for continuity.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:25:* Core signs capability manifests with an internal HMAC key stored under the local profile directory (`~/.tgc/state` or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BUSCore\state`).
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:33:* **Policy simulator**: `/policy.simulate` offers an explicit alternative to legacy “dry-run” modes.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:37:* Only configured plugins are exposed on `/plugins` and participate in `/probe`.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:38:* Each plugin manifest declares `id`, `version`, `provides`, `requires`, `stages`, and `trust_tier` for transparency.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:43:1. Inspect `docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md` for retention and clearing procedures.
docs/TRANSPARENCY.md:44:2. Review `config/policy.json` to understand allowed operations.

docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md:28:* Logs follow the same manual retention policy. Each boot creates a new file.
docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md:35:* **Transparency** – `/transparency.report` summarises active paths, retention mode, and plugin state. `/policy.simulate` lets operators inspect policy outcomes without performing an action.
docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md:39:1. **Read**: Requests go through the policy engine; allowed reads return structured data and never write to disk.
docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md:40:2. **Transform**: Input is packaged into a sandboxed subprocess. The subprocess can only propose operations; it does not persist results. The Core records the proposal in the journal and surfaces it back to the caller.
docs/DATA_LIFECYCLE.md:41:3. **Write**: Not exposed over HTTP in Core Alpha, but the primitive is available internally. It records to the journal, re-evaluates policy, and then commits with an audit record.

docs/chatgpt_startup_prompt.md:23:2. If the organization profile still shows placeholder values (business name is "Your Business Name" or the short code is `XXX`), start by running `python app.py --init-org`. Ask the operator for the business name, preferred short code (e.g., `ABC` to produce `ABC-001` SKUs), contact email, phone, website, and address. Confirm the summary written to `docs/organization_reference.md`.

METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:3:# BUS Core – Method / Process SoT (Offshoot)  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:7:The technical product SoT remains canonical for what the code actually does.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:9:This version expands the method SoT from a mostly technical process log into my **personal method “bible”**: part workflow, part portfolio, part journal of how this actually felt and what I learned.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:14:- If this doc contradicts your memory of the process → **this doc wins** until you update it.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:20:All long-lived TGC documentation (Method SoTs, technical SoTs, specs, prompts that act like SoTs, protocols) **must** use this format:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:26:- **Y – Document / product major version** - Increment when structure or meaning changes in a way that could confuse someone on an old version.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:42:- `0` = internal method track (not yet a polished public product)  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:44:- `5` = fifth patch on that structure (added The Runtime Protocol: standard prompts and high-frequency update loop)
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:73:   It’s my memory backup: a logbook, a proto-wiki, and the place I can come back to when I forget how I pulled this off the first time.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:75:2. **Future Builders** If someone who doesn’t know how to code wants to build something real using LLMs without getting lost in hype, gatekeeping, and “AI prompt bundles”, this document should give them enough **facts, patterns, and scars** to stand on my shoulders instead of starting from zero.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:122:| **“Too dumb to stop” as a feature** | No ego protection, no “real engineers don’t do it this way”     | Trained devs defend their schooling & patterns         | Ignores 20 years of cargo-cult rules that slow others   |
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:131:| Problem most trained devs have          | I never had it because…                                 | Result                                          |
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:139:Accidental advantage: by skipping the “proper curriculum”, I also skipped most of the **brakes** that curriculum installs.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:145:| Roadblock                                   | Why it normally kills solo AI projects                  | How I survived                                          |
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:149:| Throttling / quota walls across providers  | Most users never push that hard, give up when throttled | Rotated models like ammo belts and kept the loop running|
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:153:Unusual *non*-problems (things I didn’t have to fight):
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:156:- No stakeholder meetings or Jira process to satisfy  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:167:3. Shipping a real local-first product *while learning the stack live* 4. Maintaining a living, enforceable SoT that gets patched before the code does  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:168:5. Building licensing tiers, encrypted export/import, manufacturing endpoints, a tray launcher, and path migrations with **LLM-driven PRs only**, no local hand-coding
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:180:- Seeking permission, approval, or validation before changing direction  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:195:- **Account-level activity (GitHub profile):**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:196:  - “**1,047 contributions in the last year**” (profile header).
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:214:- The day I realized **SoT was the real product**, not the code  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:233:  - I still need to figure out what it would take for someone else — without my background — to pick up the SoT protocol and actually use it successfully.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:257:- **“AI is just slop/hype”** → only sees prompt spam and vibe-coded junk
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:270:For the method SoT, money matters because it proves the barrier really is low.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:273:- GPT Pro (ChatGPT Plus) for ~2 months  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:274:- Grok Pro for ~2 months  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:276:> “My cost is the price of GPT Pro and Grok Pro for 2 months. That’s it.  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:277:> No other money or YouTube tutorials or time spent other than brainstorming my plan, chatting with AI, and documenting.”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:316:> “I Need you to log all changes / updates and mark anything that **Should** become canonical in SOT to protect us and other in the future…”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:360:- In theory, a team of human devs could be dropped in and the process would still work: SoT-first, smoke-gated, incremental.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:363:The novelty is: **treating all agents (human or machine) as replaceable executors inside a fixed process that I control.**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:376:- The model is a **probability machine**, not a mind.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:378:- When the context is fully specified in SoT + prompt, results become boringly reliable.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:396:One of the quiet design rules of this project:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:444:- They produce **high-quality visual assets** (screenshots / short clips) for:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:488:- **No ego about “being a real dev”** - I never needed to prove I was doing it the “proper” way.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:493:- **Permanent-fix bias** - When a problem shows up, my instinct is not “how do I get past this once,” but  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:494:    **“how do I structure this so I never see this problem again?”** - That’s why I keep choosing harder refactors earlier instead of stacking quick hacks.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:515:## 17) Repeatability Across Projects
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:521:> “I can restart on ANY project now with the same results, without a roadmap or a plan, just putting it together as I go.”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:527:- New product idea? → Same loop: design → SoT → small change → smoke → commit.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:546:### 17.1 Core vs Pro Pattern (Data-First, Automation Later)
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:548:In BUS Core, the method produced a reusable pattern for splitting a product into **Core** and **Pro** without betraying users:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:552:  - Journaling, recent activity, and file attachments (receipts, SOPs, product docs).
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:554:  - Principle: **your data and your admin brain work forever, even if Pro is never purchased.**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:556:- **Pro (paid, automation)** - Etsy/Shopify/other sales-channel sync.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:564:> **Core = data + admin brain. Pro = robots and integrations.**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:566:This split is portable: any future project using this Method can ask the same question—  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:581:- In a traditional dev shop, I’d be the weird non-dev product owner / director.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:607:> “I ran a full-stack software team in my browser, for the cost of two pro subscriptions.”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:614:- I ask the **same control questions** at different stages of the project, for example:  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:616:  - “What are the main risks of this approach?”  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:623:Because these models are probabilistic, I treat them like an **early-warning sensor**:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:639:- A clever prompt template  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:643:- A productivity hack you can use once and forget  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:654:- “Just paste this prompt and get rich”  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:673:- **SoT removes drift** - The model is always working from one shared brain, not 100 detached prompts.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:679:- **The cost is low enough to be sustainable** - Two pro subs and spare time, not a $50k bootcamp or a dev salary.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:680:- **The process is model-agnostic** - Any capable LLM can plug in if it respects SoT and passes smoke.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:683:The point is that this is a **proven, repeatable way for a non-dev to build real, maintainable software** in 2025.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:716:- Treat Reddit’s hostility and X’s low engagement as **environmental facts**, not verdicts on the product.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:725:This section captures how I actually think about “what’s real” in the project.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:727:> “Code is fact. SoT describes code. Anything not proven in the code is speculation at best.  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:728:> If it doesn’t fit those categories, it’s a planned future / idea.”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:740:     - **Planned future**: clearly marked as not implemented yet  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:745:   - It reads the SoT and code, then proposes changes.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:762:This is also why I never needed a “500 Prompt Mega Bundle”.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:765:- I used **3–4 core prompt structures**, recycled and refined.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:766:- When I thought there was drift, I brought the **actual code and SoT back into context**, not a fresh “clever prompt”.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:773:The SoT did not start as a grand plan.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:790:2. **Built a modular, “exploded view” of the repo.** - Not prose.  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:797:3. **Promoted those facts into the first SoT.** - The initial SoT was **not** “what I wanted BUS Core to be”.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:803:     - Desire: from me → SoT as planned change  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:817:Practical takeaway for future projects:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:833:2. **Script-attempt phase** - I tried to fake this with clever shell/Python scripts glued to GPT prompts.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:851:     - each new problem in BUS Core forced a clearer rule in the Method,  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:854:So BUS Core is the **proof artifact**, and the SoT + Method protocol is the **actual invention**.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:879:## 23) The Runtime Protocol (Standard Prompts)
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:881:The SoT is the hard drive; these prompts are the operating system.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:884:### 23.1 The Work Session Prompt (Stateless Clean Room)
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:891:**The Prompt:**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:892:> **TGC BUS CORE – WORK SESSION PROMPT**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:893:> You are my development assistant for the project TGC BUS Core (Business Utility System Core) owned by True Good Craft.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:900:> - Do not “fix” or “improve” it unless I explicitly say we are updating SoT.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:904:> Do not assume features, flows, tiers, or architecture that are not explicitly present in:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:907:> Generic programming knowledge is allowed (Python, HTTP, JS, etc.), but project-specific facts must come from SoT or my words.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:913:> - Use bullets and short sections when it improves clarity.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:917:> - If I ask “what’s going on / what do we have?”: Summarize only what’s present in the provided code/SoT. Don’t infer modules or flows that aren’t shown.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:918:> - If I ask for changes or new code: Respect the SoT and the existing architecture. Show concrete snippets or patches. Explain briefly why you chose a given approach (constraints, tradeoffs), but keep it short.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:926:> Acknowledge these rules in one or two sentences, then wait for me to paste the current SoT (or the relevant sections) before doing any project-specific reasoning.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:928:### 23.2 The Delta Prompt (Human-in-the-Loop Commit)
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:933:- It buckets changes into "Facts," "Changes," and "Questions," making the review process instant.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:935:**The Prompt:**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:936:> **END-OF-SESSION SoT DELTA PROMPT**
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:937:> At the end of this work session, do the following based only on this conversation and the SoT text I provided at the start:
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:940:> Your job is to produce a delta log I can use to manually update the SoT.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:941:> No new ideas, no speculation, no guessing what I “probably meant.”
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:974:The prompts above only work because of the **cadence**.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:978:1. **Initialize:** Paste *Work Session Prompt* + Current SoT.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:980:3. **Commit:** Paste *Delta Prompt*.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:995:  - Added §23 **The Runtime Protocol (Standard Prompts)** containing the literal text of the "Work Session Prompt" and "Delta Prompt".
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:997:  - Explicitly documented the **High-Frequency Update Loop** in §23.3 to explain that SoT updates happen per-session, not per-project.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1005:  - Clarified in §17 that BUS Core is the first case study and the Method/SoT protocol is the real reusable asset.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1006:  - Promoted the X.Y.Z scheme in §0.1–0.2 to a **global rule for all TGC documentation** and made explicit that each doc’s Changelog must live at the bottom.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1007:- **v0.2.3 – 2025-11-24** - Bumped **Z** from `2` to `3` (0.2.2 → 0.2.3) to capture new Method patterns from the 2025-11-24 product/strategy session.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1010:  - Added §17.1 **Core vs Pro Pattern (Data-First, Automation Later)** to generalize the Core/Pro split into a reusable template: Core = data + admin brain, Pro = robots and integrations.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1012:  - Added §20.2 **Distribution & Community Guardrails** to document when and where to promote BUS Core (and future tools), emphasizing screenshots + working flows before heavy marketing.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1018:    - promoting that into a SoT that first described **what IS** before layering **what I WANT**,  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1020:  - Clarified in §21 that this reverse-mapping process is the practical way to recover from drift: reconstruct SoT from code → then resume the normal loop.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1023:  - Added §21 **The Hierarchy of Truth (Code → SoT → AI → Me)** to capture the “code is fact / SoT describes code / AI is executor / I am direction” model, including the idea that anything not in code is speculation or future plan and that I mainly used 3–4 core prompts, not a giant “prompt bundle”.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1026:    - The goal that someone else might be able to use this Method to improve their own problem-solving and workflow.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1035:  - Added §17 **Repeatability Across Projects** to state explicitly that this Method is portable to any new project/domain, not BUS Core-specific.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1037:  - Added §19 **What This Method is NOT** to clearly differentiate it from prompt tricks, hype, or course-funnel nonsense.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1038:  - Added §20 **Why This Method Actually Works (Meta Summary)** as a single consolidated explanation of the causal factors behind the success of the loop.
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1048:    - Profile header “1,047 contributions in the last year”.  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1056:  - First consolidated Method / Process SoT capturing:  
METHOD_SoT_v0.0.2.md:1060:    - Roadblocks and “non-problems”
