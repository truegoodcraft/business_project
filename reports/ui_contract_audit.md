## Guard Scope Notes

- Forbidden endpoint and canonical containment checks are exact quoted endpoint searches to avoid regex quoting drift across shells.
- Payload-key and multiplier/base searches remain active. Known conversion/display helpers are narrowly excluded in `token.js`, `lib/units.js`, `utils/measurement.js`, Inventory display formatting, and the recipe micro-unit label; new matches elsewhere fail the audit.
- Auth endpoint checks require `/auth/*` strings to live in `core/ui/js/auth.js`, keeping auth UI screens behind the small auth client instead of ad hoc endpoints.
