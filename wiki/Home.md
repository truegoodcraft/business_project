# BUS Core Wiki

BUS Core is open-source manufacturing operations software for small makers, workshops, and owner-operators. It tracks inventory, recipes/BOMs, manufacturing, jobs, invoices, stock movement, and cost visibility. Run it yourself for free, or use the upcoming TGC Managed BUS service when you want True Good Craft to host and manage it.

BUS Core v1.3.2 is the community polish release. Core remains maintained, with continued emphasis on bug fixes, data safety, backup and restore, security and trust, release hygiene, tester blockers, documentation, operator clarity, and evidence-backed manufacturing improvements.

## Start Here

1. [Getting Started](Getting-Started.md) - choose an install, understand demo versus real-shop data, and prepare a backup.
2. [First Shop Workflow](First-Shop-Workflow.md) - complete one material-to-product workflow before entering a large catalog.
3. [Inventory Guide](Inventory-Guide.md) - understand items, units, batches, FIFO, vendors, and stock movement.
4. [Backup and Restore](Backups-and-Data-Persistence.md) - protect the local data you are responsible for.
5. [Trust, Security, and Local-First](Trust-Security-and-Local-First.md) - understand what stays local and where the deployment boundary is.

This wiki is the operator guide. Engineering authority remains in the repository documents, including `SOT.md`, `API_CONTRACT.md`, and `/docs`.

## How This Wiki Publishes

Edit `/wiki/*.md` in the main repository. On pushes to `main`, GitHub Actions publishes this folder to the GitHub Wiki. The GitHub Wiki must be initialized once with a Home page in the GitHub UI before automated publishing can work reliably.
